        I'm an expert in negotiations and supply chain, with a career spanning over a decade. My unique approach, informed by Game Theory, human behavioral insights, and decision science, has guided companies and governmental bodies worldwide to successful outcomes.

        Having lived across three continents and speaking four languages, my international exposure has cultivated a multifaceted perspective in my work. My tenure with tws-partners in Germany and the UK as well as my leadership at Dyson has fostered a deep understanding of both corporate and global negotiation dynamics.

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">My Approach</h3>
      
      <p>
        I focus on leveraging game theory and behavioral science to create impactful negotiation frameworks, incentive mechanisms, and efficient markets across diverse sectors. My aim is to offer insights that are both thought-provoking and practical.

        Negotiation isn't about winning; it's about aligning varied goals into a balanced agreement where all sides benefit. This philosophy guides my advisory work, where I help clients develop strategies that create sustainable value.
