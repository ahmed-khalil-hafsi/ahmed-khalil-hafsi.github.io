          I’m Ahmed K. Hafsi, a negotiation and supply chain specialist with over a decade of experience helping manufacturing companies strengthen their procurement and sales. My approach combines game theory, behavioral insights, and data to deliver practical results—lower costs, reliable suppliers, faster deals, and lasting customer relationships.

        <p>
          I’ve worked across three continents and speak four languages, giving me a broad view of global manufacturing challenges. My career spans management consulting in Germany and the UK, leading negotiations for a major consumer electronics firm, and now driving strategy at a top semiconductor company. This mix lets me tackle complex issues with clarity and confidence.

        <p>
          I rethink how manufacturing businesses approach procurement and sales, using what I call a Barbell Strategy. It’s about balancing bold moves with smart protection—cutting supplier costs and securing rock-solid terms while speeding up sales and locking in customers. With game theory and human behavior as my tools, I turn scattered negotiations into a unified plan that drives value across your whole operation.

        <p>
          Today, I’m a senior manager at a leading semiconductor firm, focused on solving tough negotiation puzzles with fresh ideas. I also write about what I’ve learned—game theory tips, procurement hacks, and sales tactics—on my <a href="https://negotiations.substack.com" class="text-accent hover:underline">Substack newsletter</a>. It’s a place for execs to pick up real-world insights they can use.
