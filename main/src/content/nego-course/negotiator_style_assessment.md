# Negotiator Style Assessment Methodologies

Effective negotiation requires self-awareness about one's natural tendencies and adaptability to different situations. Negotiator style assessments help individuals understand their default approaches, strengths, weaknesses, and areas for development. This document explores various assessment methodologies and frameworks for evaluating negotiation styles.

## Common Negotiation Style Frameworks

### 1. The Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument (TKI)

While originally designed for conflict management, the TKI is widely used to assess negotiation styles. It measures behavior along two dimensions:

1. **Assertiveness**: The extent to which you try to satisfy your own concerns
2. **Cooperativeness**: The extent to which you try to satisfy others' concerns

These dimensions create five negotiation styles:

- **Competing** (assertive, uncooperative): Pursuing your concerns at the expense of others
- **Accommodating** (unassertive, cooperative): Sacrificing your concerns to satisfy others
- **Avoiding** (unassertive, uncooperative): Sidestepping or postponing the issue
- **Collaborating** (assertive, cooperative): Working to find a solution that fully satisfies all concerns
- **Compromising** (moderately assertive and cooperative): Finding an expedient, mutually acceptable solution

### 2. The Shell Bargaining Styles Assessment

Developed by Shell, this assessment identifies five negotiation styles:

- **Accommodating**: Focuses on building the relationship, sometimes at the expense of outcomes
- **Avoiding**: Prefers to minimize confrontation and may withdraw from difficult situations
- **Collaborating**: Seeks creative solutions that meet both parties' core interests
- **Competing**: Focuses on maximizing own outcomes, often through power tactics
- **Compromising**: Seeks middle ground and "fair" solutions

### 3. The Four Negotiating Personality Types

This framework identifies four distinct negotiating personality types:

- **Analytical**: Detail-oriented, methodical, and focused on facts and logic
- **Amiable**: Relationship-focused, supportive, and concerned with harmony
- **Expressive**: Creative, enthusiastic, and focused on the big picture
- **Pragmatic**: Results-oriented, efficient, and focused on practical outcomes

### 4. Aggressive-Assertive-Submissive Framework

This simpler framework categorizes negotiators into three styles:

- **Aggressive**: Focuses exclusively on own objectives, often at others' expense
- **Assertive**: Pursues own interests while respecting others' needs
- **Submissive**: Tends to yield to others' demands and avoid conflict

## Assessment Methodologies

### Self-Assessment Inventories

Self-assessment tools typically use questionnaires with statements that respondents rate on a Likert scale. For example:

- "I try to win by convincing the other party of the logic and benefits of my position."
- "I address problems and concerns directly without blame or judgment."
- "I try to find a compromise solution."
- "I see achievement as more important than relational issues."

Responses are scored to identify dominant and secondary negotiation styles.

### 360-Degree Feedback

This approach gathers input from multiple sources:
- Self-assessment
- Peer evaluations
- Supervisor assessments
- Subordinate feedback
- Client/counterpart perspectives

This comprehensive view helps identify blind spots in self-perception.

### Behavioral Observation

Trained observers evaluate negotiation behaviors during simulations or actual negotiations, coding for specific behaviors such as:
- Question types (open vs. closed)
- Information sharing patterns
- Proposal making and response patterns
- Concession behaviors
- Emotional expressions

### Situational Judgment Tests

These tests present negotiation scenarios and ask respondents to select or rate potential responses. For example:

**Scenario**: "Your supplier has just informed you that they need to increase prices by 10% due to rising costs."

**Possible responses**:
1. Firmly reject the increase and threaten to find another supplier
2. Ask for detailed justification of the cost increases
3. Propose a smaller increase phased in over time
4. Accept the increase but ask for improved payment terms

Choices reveal preferred negotiation approaches.

## Sample Assessment Questions

The following questions represent typical items found in negotiator style assessments:

1. When faced with a strong disagreement, I typically:
   - Try to find a middle ground
   - Stand firm on my position
   - Look for creative alternatives
   - Postpone the discussion
   - Yield to preserve the relationship

2. I am most comfortable in negotiations when:
   - I have detailed data and facts
   - The atmosphere is friendly and cooperative
   - There is a clear structure and process
   - I can be direct and straightforward
   - There is room for creative solutions

3. When the other party makes an unreasonable demand, I usually:
   - Counter with an equally strong position
   - Ask questions to understand their underlying interests
   - Suggest splitting the difference
   - Change the subject or take a break
   - Make a concession to maintain goodwill

4. In preparing for negotiations, I spend most time on:
   - Researching facts and figures
   - Planning relationship-building approaches
   - Developing multiple options
   - Strengthening my BATNA
   - Identifying potential compromises

5. Others would describe my negotiation style as:
   - Competitive and results-oriented
   - Collaborative and creative
   - Analytical and methodical
   - Accommodating and relationship-focused
   - Balanced and fair-minded

## Developing a Custom Assessment Tool

An effective negotiator style assessment for an interactive course should include:

### 1. Core Components

- **Self-assessment questionnaire**: 20-30 items covering various negotiation scenarios
- **Scoring mechanism**: Algorithm to calculate style preferences
- **Interpretive report**: Explanation of results with strengths and development areas
- **Situational adaptability guidance**: Recommendations for when to use different styles
- **Development plan template**: Framework for improving negotiation skills

### 2. Key Dimensions to Assess

- **Assertiveness vs. Empathy**: Balance between advocating for self and understanding others
- **Process vs. Outcome Focus**: Attention to how negotiations proceed vs. final results
- **Risk Tolerance**: Comfort with uncertainty and potential negative outcomes
- **Time Orientation**: Short-term vs. long-term perspective
- **Analytical vs. Intuitive**: Reliance on data vs. gut feelings
- **Verbal Agility**: Ability to articulate positions and respond to challenges
- **Emotional Intelligence**: Awareness and management of emotions during negotiations
- **Cultural Adaptability**: Flexibility in cross-cultural contexts

### 3. Implementation Considerations

- **Format**: Online interactive questionnaire with immediate results
- **Visual Representation**: Profile charts showing relative strengths across dimensions
- **Comparative Data**: Benchmarking against effective negotiators in various contexts
- **Practical Application**: Scenarios showing how to leverage strengths and manage weaknesses
- **Reassessment**: Capability to track development over time

## Benefits of Style Assessment

Understanding one's negotiation style offers several advantages:

1. **Self-awareness**: Recognition of default tendencies and potential blind spots
2. **Strategic flexibility**: Ability to adapt approach based on situation and counterpart
3. **Team composition**: Creating balanced negotiation teams with complementary styles
4. **Development focus**: Targeted improvement of specific skills and behaviors
5. **Counterpart analysis**: Framework for understanding and adapting to others' styles

## Conclusion

Negotiator style assessments provide valuable insights that help individuals become more effective across diverse negotiation contexts. By understanding their natural tendencies, negotiators can leverage their strengths, address their weaknesses, and adapt their approach to different situations and counterparts. An interactive course on bilateral negotiations should incorporate style assessment as a foundational element, giving participants a framework for ongoing development and situational adaptability.
