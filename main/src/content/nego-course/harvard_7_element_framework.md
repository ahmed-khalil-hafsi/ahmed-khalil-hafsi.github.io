# Harvard's 7 Element Framework for Negotiation

The 7 Element Framework, developed by the Harvard Negotiation Project, provides a comprehensive approach to negotiation preparation and execution. This framework helps negotiators analyze, prepare for, and conduct more effective negotiations by focusing on seven key elements.

## 1. Interests

Interests are the underlying needs, desires, concerns, and fears that motivate negotiators. They differ from positions, which are the stated demands or solutions that parties bring to the table.

### Key Points:
- Interests answer the question "why" someone wants something, while positions state "what" they want
- Understanding both your own interests and those of your counterpart is crucial
- Interests can include substantive (economic/business), procedural (how things are done), and relationship concerns
- Asking "why" questions helps uncover hidden interests
- Multiple interests are usually at play in any negotiation

### Application:
When negotiating for time in lieu after completing a project outside work hours, your position might be "I want three days off," but your interests could include attending a planned vacation, scheduling medical appointments, or simply recovering from burnout. Understanding these underlying interests opens up more solution possibilities.

## 2. Alternatives (BATNA)

Alternatives represent what parties can do if they fail to reach an agreement. The Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement (BATNA) is the most favorable option available if negotiations fail.

### Key Points:
- Your BATNA determines your negotiation power
- Improving your BATNA strengthens your position
- Understanding the other party's BATNA helps gauge their willingness to agree
- Never accept a deal worse than your BATNA
- WATNA (Worst Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement) sets your bottom line

### Application:
Before negotiating with a car dealer, knowing you can purchase a similar vehicle from another dealer at a specific price (your BATNA) gives you leverage and a clear walkaway point.

## 3. Relationships

The relationship between negotiating parties affects both the process and outcomes of negotiations. It can determine how fixed your stance is on certain positions and what negotiation approach you take.

### Key Points:
- Consider the importance of the relationship (one-time deal vs. ongoing partnership)
- Separate relationship issues from substantive issues
- Build rapport and trust before and during negotiations
- Consider reputation effects even in one-time negotiations
- Plan how to handle relationship challenges that may arise

### Application:
When negotiating with a long-term supplier, maintaining a positive relationship might be more important than extracting the absolute lowest price on a single order.

## 4. Options

Options are the possible agreements or parts of agreements that could satisfy both parties' interests. They represent the range of possibilities that negotiators might agree on.

### Key Points:
- Options differ from alternatives (which are what happens if you don't reach agreement)
- Brainstorm options before evaluating them
- Create value through trades that capitalize on differences in interests, priorities, and valuations
- Look for "win-win" solutions that benefit both parties
- Avoid premature judgment of options

### Application:
When buying a car, options might include different financing arrangements, warranty packages, included accessories, or delivery timing that could be combined in various ways to create a satisfactory deal.

## 5. Legitimacy

Legitimacy refers to objective standards, criteria, or benchmarks that can justify the fairness of a proposed agreement.

### Key Points:
- External standards provide objective validation for proposals
- Can include market value, precedent, expert opinion, law, or industry norms
- Helps move beyond "your word against mine" arguments
- Strengthens your position when standards support your offers
- Can weaken counterpart's position when their offers lack legitimacy

### Application:
When negotiating salary, industry salary surveys and the company's own pay scales provide legitimate standards to justify your request.

## 6. Communication

Effective communication is essential throughout the negotiation process, from preparation to implementation.

### Key Points:
- Active listening is as important as clear speaking
- Ask open-ended questions to gather information
- Acknowledge what's been said to demonstrate understanding
- Clarify and probe to uncover interests
- Be mindful of non-verbal signals
- Speak about interests rather than just positions

### Application:
Instead of immediately rejecting a proposal, asking "Help me understand why this approach works for you" can reveal interests that might be addressed through alternative solutions.

## 7. Commitments

Commitments are the agreements, promises, and obligations that parties make to each other during and at the conclusion of a negotiation.

### Key Points:
- Ensure commitments are clear, realistic, and operational
- Consider the authority level of negotiators to make commitments
- Verify the other party's ability to fulfill commitments
- Plan the sequence of commitments (who goes first)
- Include monitoring and enforcement mechanisms when needed

### Application:
Before finalizing a deal with a contractor, verify they have the authority to commit to the agreed price and timeline, and establish clear milestones and payment schedules.

## Using the Framework for Negotiation Preparation

The 7 Elements framework provides a systematic approach to negotiation preparation:

1. **Analyze your interests** and anticipate the other party's interests
2. **Identify your BATNA** and work to improve it
3. **Consider the relationship** and how to manage it
4. **Generate potential options** that might satisfy both parties
5. **Research legitimate standards** that support your position
6. **Plan your communication** strategy and questions
7. **Prepare for making and receiving commitments**

By thoroughly addressing each element, negotiators can approach the table with greater confidence and flexibility, increasing the likelihood of reaching mutually beneficial agreements.
