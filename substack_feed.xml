To many in his constituency, he is an amazing deal maker who vowed to reshape American policy in their favor. I am not here to judge the man politically, ethically, or otherwise&#8212;I can just make the observation that many people around the world struggle to understand on how to deal with him. </p><p>If you are one of those individuals that need or have to negotiate effectively with Trump or Trump-like figures, understanding and actively working on your strategic positioning is the most important first step. You must cut through the rhetoric, the multi-front campaign and the emotional news cycle. Many think they need to outmaneuver Trump with <strong>clever rhetoric </strong>in reality though, you really need to focus on how to reshape the perceived strategic equilibrium. </p><p>That doesn&#8217;t mean that communication is not important. As you reshape the strategic equilibrium, you also need to <strong>deliver</strong> that new strategic equilibrium. In a lot of cases, this should not be done <strong>publicly</strong>, nor <strong>directly in negotiations with Trump</strong>. Trump cares about a few things, but most importantly, he cares about his image. Your job is to reframe the new equilibrium in terms that boost his image and bring his <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/02/trump-effect-shows-no-slowdown/">project</a> forward. You should allow him to pivot, sell the win to his constituency, allies, rivals and the world. </p><p>Today, I only want to focus on how to <em><strong>reshape the perceived strategic equilibrium</strong></em>. I will refer to examples from Trump&#8217;s first term on how countries succeeded in advancing their own agenda while negotiating with him.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0953a487-33d4-4556-aa74-d6fdef87ba06_1920x1382.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0953a487-33d4-4556-aa74-d6fdef87ba06_1920x1382.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0953a487-33d4-4556-aa74-d6fdef87ba06_1920x1382.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0953a487-33d4-4556-aa74-d6fdef87ba06_1920x1382.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0953a487-33d4-4556-aa74-d6fdef87ba06_1920x1382.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0953a487-33d4-4556-aa74-d6fdef87ba06_1920x1382.jpeg" width="1456" height="1048" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0953a487-33d4-4556-aa74-d6fdef87ba06_1920x1382.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1048,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:747344,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0953a487-33d4-4556-aa74-d6fdef87ba06_1920x1382.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0953a487-33d4-4556-aa74-d6fdef87ba06_1920x1382.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0953a487-33d4-4556-aa74-d6fdef87ba06_1920x1382.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0953a487-33d4-4556-aa74-d6fdef87ba06_1920x1382.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">An interesting game of cards - The Cardsharps by Caravaggio</figcaption></figure></div><h3><strong>1. Credible Commitments and the Power of Irreversibility</strong></h3><p>Game theory tells us that negotiations settle into a Nash equilibrium&#8212;a state where no player benefits from unilaterally changing strategy. Trump excels in negotiations where his counterpart lacks <strong>credible commitments</strong>, allowing him to dictate the terms. To counter this, negotiators must establish firm, <strong>binding commitments</strong> that force a re-calibration of the equilibrium.</p><h4><strong>How It Works:</strong></h4><ul><li><p><strong>Pre-commitment</strong>: Legally binding agreements or automatic retaliatory mechanisms can force Trump to factor in long-term costs rather than rely on short-term leverage.</p></li><li><p><strong>Make it stronger by building coalitions</strong>: Aligning with other players (countries, business partners, stakeholders) ensures that any unilateral deviation carries heavy consequences. Coalition building extends domestically into the US too. Tommy Koh leveraged this <a href="https://negotiations.substack.com/p/lessons-from-tommy-kohs-negotiation">extremely well</a> when he negotiated the US-Singapore Free Trade Agreement. </p></li><li><p><strong>Don&#8217;t be afraid to commit.</strong> Real commitments must have real costs, otherwise they are always ignored. The higher the cost, the stronger the impact on your leverage.</p></li></ul><h4><strong>Example: China&#8217;s Tariff Retaliation in the Trade War</strong></h4><ul><li><p>Early in 2018, Trump imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, expecting China to back down. Instead, one day after Trump&#8217;s announcement, China <strong> </strong>announced that it would tariff U.S. soybeans&#8212;directly targeting Trump&#8217;s voter base in the Midwest.</p></li><li><p>This <strong>locked in costs for Trump</strong> before he could escalate further&#8212;now, any additional tariffs on China would <strong><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/business/us-farmers-suffer-body-blow-as-china-slams-door-on-farm-purchases-idUSKCN1UV0XJ/">immediately backfire on U.S. farmers</a></strong>, a crucial electoral constituency.</p></li><li><p>China also committed to diversify its soybean sources and as a direct result, Brazil&#8217;s soybean sector <a href="https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3010480/us-china-trade-war-has-been-boon-brazils-soybean-farmers-can">flourished</a> significantly.</p></li><li><p>A key partner to China in the US Soybean Business, is the <strong>American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF), </strong>the most powerful US agricultural lobby<strong>.</strong> Trump&#8217;s actions triggered immense <strong><a href="https://www.fb.org/farm-bureau-news/farm-bureau-to-congress-tariffs-impact-on-u-s-agriculture-must-be-considered">pressure</a></strong> from the AFBF, which warned that <strong>farmers were being sacrificed in a geopolitical dispute</strong>. The AFBF publicly <strong>urged the administration to de-escalate</strong>, emphasizing that retaliatory tariffs disproportionately harmed American agriculture.</p></li><li><p>As a result, Trump had to <strong>shift strategy</strong> and ultimately signed the <strong>Phase One deal in 2020</strong>, securing a partial retreat without fully conceding. Domestically in 2019, Trump <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/14/donald-trump-coronavirus-farmer-bailouts-359932">paid US farmers</a> subsidies worth 23 (!) Billion USD.</p></li><li><p><strong>Why it worked:</strong> China used <strong>credible commitment</strong>, ensuring that Trump&#8217;s decision tree now included domestic economic and political consequences that <strong>limited his freedom to escalate</strong>.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>2. Exit Strategies and Threat Neutralization</strong></h3><h4><strong>How It Works:</strong></h4><ul><li><p><strong>Define a Strong BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement):</strong> If you can't get a good deal, make it clear you will walk away and <strong>not</strong> return. Trump exploits people who leave the door open for renegotiation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Control the Clock:</strong> Trump thrives on running out the clock, pushing the other side into making concessions under pressure. Counteract this by making it clear that <strong>your deal has an expiration date</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Make it stronger by leveraging third-party influence</strong>: Trump is highly attuned on public perception. Using media, business leaders, or political allies to reinforce strategic messages can alter his calculus.</p></li></ul><h4><strong>A Masterclass: Mexico Neutralizing Trump's 2019 Tariff Threat</strong></h4><ul><li><p>In 2019, Trump threatened to impose tariffs on Mexico unless they agreed to stronger border security measures.</p></li><li><p>Mexico understood Trump&#8217;s need for a quick &#8220;win&#8221; but also knew he didn&#8217;t want a prolonged tariff war with a major U.S. supply chain hub.</p></li><li><p>Instead of directly fighting, <strong>Mexico leveraged third-party influence</strong>&#8212;U.S. corporate pressure (automakers in Texas and Michigan opposed the tariffs), along with <a href="https://www.uschamber.com/international/business-community-opposes-tariffs-mexico">push back</a> from Republican senators and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.</p></li><li><p>Mexico didn&#8217;t confront Trump&#8212;it let his own political allies do it<strong>.</strong></p></li><li><p>At the same time, Mexico&#8217;s foreign minister Marcelo Ebrard <strong>publicly signaled that Mexico would not accept any deal if tariffs were imposed</strong>, warning of retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agriculture.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/66295d3c-8985-11e9-a028-86cea8523dc2">Trump needed a quick victory</a></strong>&#8212;so when Mexico made minor, face-saving commitments, Trump accepted a resolution that allowed him to claim victory without a prolonged dispute.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank"

Trump head-on&#8212;it shaped his incentives.</strong> By quietly letting <strong>U.S. business leaders</strong> and <strong>Republican lawmakers</strong> push back on Trump, Mexico forced a resolution without making concessions of real substance.</p></li><li><p>This shows how exit strategies don&#8217;t have to be publicly aggressive&#8212;they just need to shift Trump&#8217;s incentives<strong>.</strong></p></li></ul><h3><strong>3. Strategic Signaling and Shaping Expectations</strong></h3><p>Trump often employs <strong>strategic ambiguity</strong>&#8212;keeping opponents off balance by making extreme claims, setting unpredictable red lines, or showing irrationality. Game theory teaches us that in <strong>signaling games</strong>, controlling information flow is the most important lever. By shaping expectations, you can steer Trump&#8217;s decision-making toward more favorable outcomes.</p><h4><strong>How It Works:</strong></h4><ul><li><p>Combine messages of cooperation and credible threat to prevent him from assuming total control of the game.</p></li><li><p>Regularly provide Trump&#8212;or better his advisors&#8212;with clear evidence that continued aggression will have negative payoffs, prompting a reassessment of his approach.</p></li></ul><h4><strong>Example: Iran &amp; EU Defending the JCPOA</strong></h4><p>In 2018 and after Trump pulled out of the <a href="https://negotiations.substack.com/p/solving-complexity-in-global-diplomacy">Iran nuclear deal </a>(check the article I wrote a while ago on this topic) and reimposed sanctions, Iran used a <strong>calibrated signaling strategy</strong>:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Combining Messages of Cooperation and Credible Threats</strong>: It <a href="https://www.armscontrol.org/issue-briefs/2019-12/assessing-risk-posed-iran-violations-nuclear-deal">incrementally</a> breached JCPOA limits in a <strong>reversible way</strong> (slightly increasing uranium enrichment), signaling that full compliance was still possible if Trump reversed sanctions.</p></li><li><p>In an action that further reinforced Iran&#8217;s negotiation position, the EU created the INSTEX financial mechanism to <strong>signal long-term economic incentives</strong> for Iran to stay in the deal.</p></li><li><p>Iran avoided direct escalation but made it clear that if Trump continued escalation, they would retaliate.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Iran outlasted Trump&#8217;s administration and resumed talks with Biden in 2021&#8212;showing that <strong>patient signaling changed the game.</strong></p></li></ul><h3><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h3><p>Poker players bluff, intimidate, and control perception. If you change the table rules, you change the game. Game theory provides the tools to change the table rules. By creating <strong>binding commitments</strong>, <strong>shaping an Exit Strategy</strong>, and strategically <strong>signaling intent to change expectations</strong>, negotiators can <strong>redefine the rules of engagement</strong> and force even the most unpredictable players into stable, cooperative outcomes. </p><p>Negotiating with Trump is not a threat; it is an incredible opportunity for anybody willing to dance the right dance.</p><p>Thanks for reading <em>Games &amp; Negotiations</em>!

Outside, the world is working from home, but your team is here, on the frontlines, managing a supply crisis that threatens to bring everything to a standstill. The latest email from your supplier flashes on your screen, and what started as a promising negotiation for electronic components has quickly spiraled into a full-scale battle.</p><p>The shortages caused by the pandemic are hitting hard &#8212; skyrocketing prices, unpredictable delivery schedules, and a supplier suddenly unwilling to commit. It&#8217;s becoming clear that what should have been a routine deal has escalated into a high-stakes standoff. The familiar signs of conflict are there: rising demands, shrinking flexibility, and an undercurrent of frustration on both sides. It feels like everything could fall apart at any moment.</p><p>Sounds familiar? During COVID-19, escalation in negotiations became a constant for many teams in supply chain. When supply chains crumbled, escalation wasn&#8217;t just a possibility; it became the new norm. Whether used to gain leverage or as a desperate attempt to push through a deal, escalation was often the only path forward. Before we dive into the strategies we can use to manage this, let&#8217;s break down what escalation in negotiation really means.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe05eb23e-e035-4413-b59d-bcf42d3703d2_1402x1080.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe05eb23e-e035-4413-b59d-bcf42d3703d2_1402x1080.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe05eb23e-e035-4413-b59d-bcf42d3703d2_1402x1080.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe05eb23e-e035-4413-b59d-bcf42d3703d2_1402x1080.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe05eb23e-e035-4413-b59d-bcf42d3703d2_1402x1080.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe05eb23e-e035-4413-b59d-bcf42d3703d2_1402x1080.jpeg" width="1402" height="1080" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e05eb23e-e035-4413-b59d-bcf42d3703d2_1402x1080.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1080,&quot;width&quot;:1402,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:526209,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe05eb23e-e035-4413-b59d-bcf42d3703d2_1402x1080.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe05eb23e-e035-4413-b59d-bcf42d3703d2_1402x1080.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe05eb23e-e035-4413-b59d-bcf42d3703d2_1402x1080.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe05eb23e-e035-4413-b59d-bcf42d3703d2_1402x1080.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">The &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oath_of_the_Horatii">Oath of the Horatii</a>" by Jacques-Louis David.

There&#8217;s tension, but both sides are still engaged, believing a beneficial agreement is possible - at least for them. However this doesn&#8217;t mean everything is harmonious - quite far from it actually. Disagreements and back-and-forth demands are common, and actions begin to speak louder than words.</p><p>Consider the negotiation between a large retailer and a supplier over volume discounts. At this stage, both sides present their cases: the supplier explains why they can&#8217;t reduce prices further, citing rising material costs, while the retailer pushes for larger discounts, banking on their purchasing power. The exchange remains professional, and both sides believe there&#8217;s room for concessions.</p><p>Most negotiations start and even end at this stage, Its important at this stage of escalation to <strong>not let negative emotions take over</strong>. Keep the exchange focussed on <strong>facts</strong>, <strong>figures</strong>, and <strong>each party&#8217;s interests</strong>. Being gentle in managing this stage allows you to strategically trigger the next stage of escalation in case a deadlock arises. Here, It&#8217;s not about creating conflict for conflict&#8217;s sake, but about leveraging tension to push for a resolution. For example, escalating by introducing <strong>higher-level stakeholders, removing certain agreed elements</strong> or setting <strong>stricter deadlines</strong> can signal seriousness and increase pressure, allowing the other party to reconsider their position. However, this must be done with <strong>precision and a lot of positive signalling</strong>. You have to allow and signal for a clear path of win-win. In all cases, strategically using escalations should serve as a calculated risk, never as an emotional reaction.</p><p>At this stage escalation means highlighting the consequences of inaction or continued rigidity, without <strong>provoking a retaliatory escalation</strong> from the other side. This is quite important when the negotiation involves <strong>long-term partnerships</strong>, where <strong>trust</strong> and <strong>cooperation</strong> are critical. Timing is key &#8212; escalating too soon or too aggressively can easily backfire, pushing the negotiation into a win-lose dynamic, making cooperation harder to re-establish later.</p><p>Now, let&#8217;s go to the next level of escalation according to Glasl.</p><h2>You failed a Win-Win? Win-Lose now starts creeping in &#8230;</h2><p>The tone shifts. What started as a conversation over details now becomes a test of strength and <em>endurance</em>. The original issues&#8212;whether it&#8217;s pricing, terms, or lead times&#8212;takes a backseat as both sides become more focused on gaining the upper hand. In procurement, this often manifests as suppliers threatening to walk away or buyers leveraging their position to demand steep concessions.</p><p>Take, for instance, a scenario where a manufacturer demands last-minute changes to a contract, threatening to look for alternative suppliers if their terms aren&#8217;t met. The supplier, feeling cornered, might counter by tightening delivery schedules or refusing to provide critical data needed for the negotiation.</p><p>This phase is a slippery slope. It&#8217;s where parties start pulling in reinforcements &#8212; legal teams, external consultants, or other stakeholders &#8212; to fortify their position. The discussion is no longer about finding a mutually beneficial solution but about winning. </p><p>So how to deal with counter-parties forcing you into this phase? Rather than meeting escalation with equal force, adopt a strategy of <strong>measured responses</strong>. Push back just enough to show you're serious, but not so much that you close off further dialogue. This approach is basically the <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/game-theory/">game-theoretic</a> <strong>Tit-for-Tat strategy</strong>, where a proportional response signals both firmness and a willingness to cooperate. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b0a54df-b143-4ba1-aa6c-6312c60e1ed5_1402x280.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b0a54df-b143-4ba1-aa6c-6312c60e1ed5_1402x280.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b0a54df-b143-4ba1-aa6c-6312c60e1ed5_1402x280.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b0a54df-b143-4ba1-aa6c-6312c60e1ed5_1402x280.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b0a54df-b143-4ba1-aa6c-6312c60e1ed5_1402x280.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b0a54df-b143-4ba1-aa6c-6312c60e1ed5_1402x280.png" width="1402" height="280" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4b0a54df-b143-4ba1-aa6c-6312c60e1ed5_1402x280.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:280,&quot;width&quot;:1402,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:73724,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b0a54df-b143-4ba1-aa6c-6312c60e1ed5_1402x280.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b0a54df-b143-4ba1-aa6c-6312c60e1ed5_1402x280.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b0a54df-b143-4ba1-aa6c-6312c60e1ed5_1402x280.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b0a54df-b143-4ba1-aa6c-6312c60e1ed5_1402x280.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Tit-for-tat strategy definition from the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy </figcaption></figure></div><p>By responding in kind but leaving the door open for resolution, you demonstrate that you're still committed to finding common ground&#8212;provided the other party is prepared to do the same. This is of course not universal advice. Your mileage might vary significantly.</p><h2>And at last, we are at Lose-Lose.</h2><p>This is the last stage of Glasl&#8217;s model and this is the point of no return&#8212;when both sides become so focused on their positions that the original goal is forgotten, and the only priority left is damage control. In procurement and sales, this could mean contracts being canceled, partnerships breaking down, or even legal action. At this stage, it&#8217;s no longer about finding a solution. Instead, both sides are trying to minimize their losses and protect whatever is left of the business relationship.</p><p>What makes this stage difficult is that, unlike in earlier phases, escalation can no longer be used <strong>strategically</strong>. As Glasl describes it, you are already in the abyss. More escalation at this point simply prolongs the conflict, often with more damage on both sides. Psychologically, the lose-lose state can become stable because both parties are locked into a cycle of retaliation, where admitting defeat or backing down feels like a loss of face or credibility. Behavioral science tells us that humans tend to double down in such scenarios, driven by the sunk cost fallacy&#8212;the idea that because they&#8217;ve already invested so much into the conflict, walking away feels like a greater loss than continuing the fight.</p><p>This is why, once you reach the lose-lose stage, it&#8217;s incredibly hard to reverse course. Both sides are focused on inflicting damage on the other rather than seeking mutual gain, and any further escalation only drags both parties deeper into the cycle of loss.</p><p>For example, imagine a buyer insists on harsh penalties for late deliveries, and the supplier, feeling cornered, decides to walk away from the deal altogether&#8212;even if it means losing an important client. In the end, the buyer faces supply disruptions, and the supplier loses a major contract. Both sides end up worse off than before.</p><p>Being in this stage means both sides are struggling to make progress at the negotiation table. If you find yourself here, it&#8217;s critical to <strong>stay calm</strong>, <strong>measured</strong>, and avoid <strong>letting negative emotions</strong> take control. De-escalation often involves shifting the dynamics in a real radical way&#8212;whether it&#8217;s bringing in a fresh team, giving the negotiation a lot more time, or changing a key part of the process, like introducing mediation or arbitration. Unfortunately, many negotiations stall at this point, and the chances of reaching a resolution become slim to none. While being stuck, many negotiators with strong BATNAs will try to escalate even further at this stage - this doesn&#8217;t work. You can&#8217;t &#8216;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/iN1UslEeTB0">escalate to de-escalate</a>&#8217; once you are at this stage (Check out Jon Stewart&#8217;s The Daily Show segment for that video!)</p><p>As a reminder to all negotiators: humans are far from purely rational beings. Fairness, respect, and saving face are crucial elements in any negotiation.

I&#8217;ve just woken up. I&#8217;m reading my daily briefing email from the Times and there it stands in bold letters <em><strong>Monday Briefing: Biden clashes with Netanyahu. </strong></em>For some, what is happening may seem like a normal round of political discourse during an election year. For others, it may even seem like a second act of a theatrical play - well played and well directed for domestic and foreign viewers alike. </p><p>Nevertheless, in a recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/01/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-richard-haass.html">episode</a> on the Ezra Klein Podcast, <a href="https://twitter.com/RichardHaass">Richard Haass</a>, a cornerstone of the US foreign policy establishment, <a href="https://richardhaass.substack.com/">argues</a> how the US foreign policy is becoming insufficiently independent and how it became captured by allies: Israel in South West Asia and Ukraine in Eastern Europe. He is arguing that the US has lost its ability to control, confront and even influence its allies. </p><p>Richard makes a really interesting point - most people would think the US is this large superpower that simply dictates to the rest of the world what to do. That may have been true for some time, especially in the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union, but I think reality today is much more nuanced and complicated than that. I believe the re-emergence of challenger powers across the world increases the <em>option space</em> within which traditional US allies can maneuver which allows them to gain  more leverage than &#8220;the fair share&#8221; in their value claiming process with the US. Think of the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/03/10/saudi-iran-diplomatic-ties-restored/">unprecedented Saudi-Iranian rapprochement</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-16/german-direct-investment-in-china-rose-to-record-in-2023">Germany&#8217;s record investments in China last year</a> and many other examples. </p><p>This article is not really about the US&#8217;s handling of its relationship with its allies, traditional or new. But rather I want to use the current direction of events as a backdrop to discuss strategies on how to effectively negotiate with allies. </p><p>So how do you negotiate with allies?</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1278ce4a-8a56-4ae4-9bb5-6c6d017171c9_1920x2235.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1278ce4a-8a56-4ae4-9bb5-6c6d017171c9_1920x2235.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1278ce4a-8a56-4ae4-9bb5-6c6d017171c9_1920x2235.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1278ce4a-8a56-4ae4-9bb5-6c6d017171c9_1920x2235.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1278ce4a-8a56-4ae4-9bb5-6c6d017171c9_1920x2235.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1278ce4a-8a56-4ae4-9bb5-6c6d017171c9_1920x2235.jpeg" width="490" height="570.4326923076923" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1278ce4a-8a56-4ae4-9bb5-6c6d017171c9_1920x2235.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1695,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:490,&quot;bytes&quot;:638892,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1278ce4a-8a56-4ae4-9bb5-6c6d017171c9_1920x2235.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1278ce4a-8a56-4ae4-9bb5-6c6d017171c9_1920x2235.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1278ce4a-8a56-4ae4-9bb5-6c6d017171c9_1920x2235.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1278ce4a-8a56-4ae4-9bb5-6c6d017171c9_1920x2235.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">&#8220;<a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/children-teaching-a-cat-to-dance-known-as-the-dancing-lesson-jan-havicksz-steen/sAFdhRy2KCBhPA">Children Teaching a Cat to Dance</a>&#8221; by Jan Steen captures the essence of negotiating with allies &#8212; is the dog a threat? also nobody understands what the hell are they doing to that poor cat!</figcaption></figure></div><p>Negotiating with allies is not exactly easy. By definition, you need your allies. Maybe more than they need you - or sometimes it looks that way anyway. Negotiating with allies can also be really weird, an ultimate exercise in rationality and a true test if you understand your <a href="https://www.pon.harvard.edu/daily/batna/translate-your-batna-to-the-current-deal/">BATNA</a> (Best Alternative To A Negotiated Agreement) and the game you are in. Sounds intriguing - but the reality is, negotiating with current or new allies is the same game as negotiating with anybody else and as in any negotiation, you always need a set of tools for value creation and a set of tools for value claiming. The key here is mastering the balance, claim too much and you won&#8217;t have an ally - this applies for you <em>and </em>for the ally. Create too much value and you just <em>might</em> get taken for granted and ghosted for a while <em>or worse</em>. Biden&#8217;s team might know what I am talking about here.</p><p>So how to get this balance? In my view, the balance depends on what game you are in. Game Theory has a few interesting frameworks that helps us understand cooperation in a deep way. Let&#8217;s get started.</p><h3>I. Coordination Games</h3><p>Coordination games in game theory involve situations where all participants can benefit from making mutually consistent decisions without any inherent conflict between their interests. </p><p>The main issue in a coordination game is <strong>not about persuading someone to work with you &#8212; it's about agreeing on how to work together</strong>. In the context of negotiating with allies, both sides generally aim for a cooperative outcome (i.e. maybe economic alliance) but might have different views on achieving it (Do we want freedom of movement or a universal central bank, a single currency or multiple etc &#8230;).</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F60d6fd60-0af7-4cf7-8262-5e58a3c1bae0_640x455.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F60d6fd60-0af7-4cf7-8262-5e58a3c1bae0_640x455.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F60d6fd60-0af7-4cf7-8262-5e58a3c1bae0_640x455.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F60d6fd60-0af7-4cf7-8262-5e58a3c1bae0_640x455.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F60d6fd60-0af7-4cf7-8262-5e58a3c1bae0_640x455.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F60d6fd60-0af7-4cf7-8262-5e58a3c1bae0_640x455.jpeg" width="640" height="455" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/60d6fd60-0af7-4cf7-8262-5e58a3c1bae0_640x455.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:455,&quot;width&quot;:640,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:135131,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F60d6fd60-0af7-4cf7-8262-5e58a3c1bae0_640x455.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F60d6fd60-0af7-4cf7-8262-5e58a3c1bae0_640x455.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F60d6fd60-0af7-4cf7-8262-5e58a3c1bae0_640x455.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F60d6fd60-0af7-4cf7-8262-5e58a3c1bae0_640x455.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Pieter Bruegel the Elder's &#8220;The Hay Harvest&#8221; illustrates the coordination game.</figcaption></figure></div><h4>Features of Coordination Games</h4><ul><li><p><strong>Multiple equilibria</strong>: There are several outcomes that all parties would be satisfied with, but these outcomes are not equally preferable to all involved. The goal of the coordination game, is to coordinate preferences to find out an  equilibrium (i.e. set of strategies for each player) that maximizes collective benefits.</p></li><li><p><strong>Communication is crucial</strong>: Since the problem is less about conflict and more about selection among equilibria, effective communication becomes vital. Parties need to share information in a clever way to understand each other's preferences and constraints.</p></li><li><p><strong>Forward-looking</strong>: Successful coordination often requires considering not only current preferences but also how choices will impact future interactions and the long-term relationship.</p></li></ul><p>Let&#8217;s look at the example of setting international standards for online privacy such as the EU&#8217;s GDPR. Countries and their tech industries benefit massively from having a unified set of standards. However, the different national security requirements, data protection laws, and technological capabilities mean there are multiple possible standards (equilibria) that could be universally adopted. </p><p>Negotiating such standards is a coordination game. The challenge is not convincing countries of the need for standards but deciding which standards to adopt. The negotiation would involve extensive discussions, sharing of technical knowledge, and understanding of each country's legal constraints and commercial interests.</p><p>Internal company alignment between cross functional stakeholders is also a good example of a coordination game (Typical example: the procurement department needs to coordinate with stakeholders such as quality, operations and others - everyone knows they need to select a vendor, however each has a different set of priorities and preferences).</p><p>In my view, one of the best ways to master the coordination game is to skilfully frame a menu offer. Here you propose options where multiple equilibria exist. Depending on the feedback from across the table, you can take it further and iterate the negotiation on it. The various options will reveal relative preferences in a clever way, without showing absolute valuations (so it can&#8217;t be used against you for value claiming purposes). </p><p>Alternatively, you can also adopt a phased approach where views are harmonised over time with a final deal-or-nothing-at-all type of structure (i.e. we gradually agree on things, but if negotiations break down, then we go back to step 1 and all gradual wins are erased). This is a popular approach in international negotiations (for example Oslo negotiations and also many free trade agreements). I am not the biggest fan of this approach but it does work for certain situations especially when momentum can be kept and where the benefits of the initial wins surpass the value loss of negotiation break-down. </p><p>In the Oslo Accords negotiations between the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization) and the Government of Israel in the 90s, the breakthrough was to focus on gradual and small wins tackling low hanging fruit such as recognition and some autonomy - Building on top of that to create enough trust in order to negotiate the more difficult issues such as Jerusalem, refugees and borders. With today&#8217;s hindsight, Oslo <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/09/13/oslo-accords-1993-anniversary-israel-palestine-peace-process-lessons/">failed completely</a> to deliver a better than BATNA outcome, for both Israel and the PLO. In my view, Oslo Accords were played as a coordination game, but in reality this was a prisoner&#8217;s dilemma, not solvable through a gradual trust building exercise - but rather through strong initial and credible commitment. </p><p>Another example of a gradual approach in a coordination game is the negotiation of the RCEP (The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership) which is a massive free trade treaty that covers almost 30% of the world&#8217;s GDP and that includes 15 countries in Asia Pacific from Japan, Korea, all of ASEAN to Australia and China. The negotiations lasted over a decade with 31 negotiation rounds.

Assurance Games</h3><p>Assurance games in game theory or also called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stag_hunt">Stag Hunt Game</a> are games that describe a conflict between safety, risk taking and social cooperation.

Both hunters can&#8217;t talk to each other and must decide independently. </p><p>If both hunt together, they can both hunt a big animal (a stag); If both choose to work individually, both hunt a small animal (a hare) as only cooperation allows to hunt the stag. </p><p>If on the other hand, one chooses to hunt together and the other chooses to hunt individually - The hunter that decided to cooperate (hunt together) won&#8217;t get anything and the other hunter will get the small animal. </p><p>To summarise - Cooperate and if you are lucky enough to have a trustworthy partner, both of you will receive the ultimate outcome. But be careful who to trust - if the partner is a cunning partner, you will be hungry! However, If you play safe (i.e. choose to hunt alone) then you are guaranteed to eat for the day.</p><p>So, what would you do? How do you make sure you can <strong>trust</strong> your allies? </p><p>The 1st step is to accept that you and your allies are in this game. The 2nd step is you need to make your allies trust you - <em>not the other way around</em>. <strong>Commitment</strong> generally helps with this. You need to demonstrate in a credible way that you are going to hunt the stag (for example, you declare that hare&#8217;s meat is not edible and you actually stop eating hare!). </p><p>NATO with its commitment of mutual defence is a typical example of commitment in an assurance game.</p><p>Another example is nuclear non-proliferation treaties - the assurance comes from verification mechanisms and the promise of mutual defence and other benefits like technological aid and protection pacts - making sure that the stag is worth so much more than the hare (i.e. working on individual nuclear armament).</p><p>Sometimes you don&#8217;t even need trust - Things like acting irrational (i.e. I will choose to be hungry until we go stag hunting) can be a very successful but it&#8217;s a risky strategy. There is a reason people generally cooperate with toddlers and children even though they don&#8217;t trust them. </p><p>Direct communication is also an incredible tool to demonstrate that an ally can trust you. The key here is creating a backchannel to give direct access to top decision makers. This is very powerful and it has been used for a long time by brilliant diplomats and influential politicians as a strategy to manage important international relationships (Read <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/26/books/review/master-of-the-game-martin-indyk.html">master of the game</a> by Martin Indyk if you want to learn more about this).</p><p>A final strategy is to show a real vulnerability that you have. This <strong>will allow</strong> your ally to trust you. Sometimes it&#8217;s about finding the right vulnerability or if you are resourceful enough - creating it.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Arms_Limitation_Talks">SALT (Strategic Arms Limitation Talks) negotiations </a> are an example where the weakness to truly control nuclear arms has been used as a tool to allow for cooperation between the US and the Soviet Union.</p><p>Alright, that&#8217;s it for today.

as Singapore's ambassador to the United Nations. Renowned for resolving international disputes, Koh had led massive negotiations, including the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea and the Rio "Earth Summit". However, despite his successes, he hadn't achieved one of his dreams: securing a free trade agreement between his home country: Singapore and the U.S. </p><p>Fast forward almost a decade - the date now is November 2000. Charlene Barshefsky, who was the U.S. Special Trade Representative, made a brief stop in Singapore. She was on her way to join President Bill Clinton at a conference in Brunei organised by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). While in Singapore, she and Steven Green (US Ambassador to Singapore) came up with an idea: it was the perfect time to suggest a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between the U.S. and Singapore (USSFTA). They quickly shared this plan with Lee Kuan Yew and Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, recommending that Goh discuss the idea with Clinton during the Brunei meeting.</p><p>After hearing the proposal, Goh and Lee Kuan Yew did not hesitate. The issue was that Goh and Clinton did not have a meeting in Brunei - They needed to figure out a way to get both leaders long enough alone for Goh to pitch the idea to Clinton.</p><p>It was a bold idea - The US is the worlds superpower post the collapse of the Soviet Union almost a decade ago. Many nations wanted access to the US markets. Singapore was on the list, but was nowhere near the top. Politically, time was also running out and Clinton was only a few months still in the presidency. Sources tell that Barshefsky did not tell her superiors about the proposal. Despite this, the proposal was founded on a strong case. America did not have an FTA signed with any nation in Asia - Despite Asia&#8217;s increasing influence and power globally. Specifically, Singapore had American Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) in the island nation reaching 27$ billion in 2001, an exponentially growing economy with lots of ties to American interests and thousands of Americans working in Singapore. The ground was fertile for an FTA that would <a href="https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/05/20030506-11.html">benefit both countries</a> (Read President Bush&#8217;s statement with the benefits of free trade to people across the table - Contrast this with our reality 2 decades later of de-globalisation and &#8220;de-risking&#8221; - But I digress).</p><p>Now let&#8217;s go back to Tommy Koh - During a leisurely stroll, Tommy Koh was interrupted by a call from the Singapore Trade Minister, George Yeo. Yeo shared exciting news: the night before, Singapore's Prime Minister, Goh Chok Tong, had proposed a late-night golf game to U.S. President Bill Clinton during an APEC conference in Brunei. Amidst the game, Goh suggested a U.S.-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (USSFTA), highlighting its ease and symbolic value. Clinton agreed, and the plan was publicly announced the next morning (to the surprise of Madeleine Albright!). This allowed Singapore to jump the list, but still it was far from an easy play to close this deal.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8dd1fd9d-69f5-4192-a5e7-878b5734cdcb_1024x1024.webp" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8dd1fd9d-69f5-4192-a5e7-878b5734cdcb_1024x1024.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8dd1fd9d-69f5-4192-a5e7-878b5734cdcb_1024x1024.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8dd1fd9d-69f5-4192-a5e7-878b5734cdcb_1024x1024.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8dd1fd9d-69f5-4192-a5e7-878b5734cdcb_1024x1024.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8dd1fd9d-69f5-4192-a5e7-878b5734cdcb_1024x1024.webp" width="420" height="420" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8dd1fd9d-69f5-4192-a5e7-878b5734cdcb_1024x1024.webp&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1024,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:420,&quot;bytes&quot;:233432,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/webp&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8dd1fd9d-69f5-4192-a5e7-878b5734cdcb_1024x1024.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8dd1fd9d-69f5-4192-a5e7-878b5734cdcb_1024x1024.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8dd1fd9d-69f5-4192-a5e7-878b5734cdcb_1024x1024.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8dd1fd9d-69f5-4192-a5e7-878b5734cdcb_1024x1024.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">A late night golf game between Singapore&#8217;s Goh and the US&#8217;s Clinton on the sides of the APEC conference allowed for the FTA proposition to be pitched.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Yeo then asked Koh if he would lead the negotiations for this potential agreement. Eager to bring this long-desired deal to fruition, Koh readily accepted.</p><p>December 2000, Koh left for the United States with a large delegation and started laying down a negotiation strategy.</p><p>This post is not about going through all the details of this negotiation - I will only focus on a few interesting signalling games that I believe were key elements in navigating this complex multi-level negotiation.</p><h3>Starting Right.</h3><p>As Clinton's term ended and George W. Bush's was about to begin (late January 2001), Koh realised two months are impossible to finalize a trade agreement. Washington is in a transition time and is not ready for decisions yet. Koh had a key realisation: Bush&#8217;s team will support the agreement if it were perceived <em>different </em>from whatever Clinton&#8217;s team had in mind (Clinton thought of a Jordan style FTA, a relatively narrow scoped agreement whereas Bush&#8217;s team would be pitched eventually a comprehensive agreement). Koh called PM Goh and told him it is not possible to finish the agreement in 2 months and that he needs more time. Goh supported this.</p><h3>Not a Negotiation, but a Negotiation Campaign.</h3><p>Koh understood that negotiating with the United States was distinct from other countries. While most nations centralize trade negotiations within the president or prime minister's office, the U.S. process is multifaceted. The U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) leads negotiations but must consider the views of various interest groups and governmental bodies. Koh noted the complexity of dealing with the U.S. government, likening it to a multilateral system (similar to the negotiations he led at the UN) due to its decentralised power. </p><p>An FTA with the U.S. necessitates public consultation, consent from advisory groups, negotiations with the USTR, support from federal agencies, and approval from the Senate and House of Representatives. Koh and his team had to navigate this intricate landscape in what he termed a "multi-front negotiation campaign."</p><h3>Makan Diplomacy.</h3><p>This negotiation had over 21 issues to be negotiated among the various working groups. With such a complicated setting, Tommy Koh knew that some complicated issues are better negotiated informally. He has encouraged what became to be known as &#8220;makan diplomacy.&#8221; Through informal chats over food, Singapore signalled that it is open, trustworthy, and eager to build genuine connections.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16f03c88-2cfa-455f-a2d6-3b4a85ce1bbb_1024x1024.webp" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16f03c88-2cfa-455f-a2d6-3b4a85ce1bbb_1024x1024.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16f03c88-2cfa-455f-a2d6-3b4a85ce1bbb_1024x1024.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16f03c88-2cfa-455f-a2d6-3b4a85ce1bbb_1024x1024.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16f03c88-2cfa-455f-a2d6-3b4a85ce1bbb_1024x1024.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16f03c88-2cfa-455f-a2d6-3b4a85ce1bbb_1024x1024.webp" width="458" height="458" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/16f03c88-2cfa-455f-a2d6-3b4a85ce1bbb_1024x1024.webp&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1024,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:458,&quot;bytes&quot;:276624,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/webp&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16f03c88-2cfa-455f-a2d6-3b4a85ce1bbb_1024x1024.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16f03c88-2cfa-455f-a2d6-3b4a85ce1bbb_1024x1024.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16f03c88-2cfa-455f-a2d6-3b4a85ce1bbb_1024x1024.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F16f03c88-2cfa-455f-a2d6-3b4a85ce1bbb_1024x1024.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Makan Diplomacy as imagined by Dalle-E</figcaption></figure></div><h3>Conditional Concessions.</h3><p>One of the interesting strategies deployed by Singapore's negotiation team was the use of conditional concessions, a nuanced form of signalling that played a critical role in shaping the dialogue. In simple terms, <strong>Singapore was willing to make certain sacrifices, but these were not blank checks</strong>. </p><h3>Open Doors: Showing Confidence.</h3><p>Singapore's absence of a minimum wage made it vulnerable to criticism from powerful American unions, which could potentially obstruct the negotiations in Congress. A decade earlier, Koh had built a rapport with leaders of the influential AFL-CIO union, earning their respect. Seizing the opportunity, Koh addressed their concerns directly.</p><p>He arranged for Singapore's trade union to invite AFL-CIO leaders to assess the working conditions in Singapore's factories. Koh aimed to demonstrate transparency and assure them that labor violations were not widespread. Although the union leaders appreciated Koh's efforts and were reassured by what they saw, they still opposed the free trade agreements on principle.</p><p>Koh realised that while the unions might not publicly support the agreement, they might agree not to actively oppose it. The union leaders agreed to this, preventing a potential roadblock to the negotiations.</p><h3>The Ban On Chewing Gum: A Lesson in Flexibility</h3><p>In a casual chat, a government official from Singapore asked Koh about how the talks were going. Koh shared that he was facing some pushback from a company in Chicago. When pressed for details, Koh mentioned it was all about chewing gum. The official, thinking Koh was joking, started to leave, but Koh quickly assured him it was a real issue.</p><p>Wrigley, a big American chewing gum maker, had issues with Singapore's strict rules against littering and bans on items like gum that might be tricky to clean. The ban on chewing gum came after an incident that delayed the city's modern subway system. The government responded with strict penalties, including large fines. Wrigley hadn't had much luck in Singapore before, but now it could use its influence with the USTR and their member of congress, the chairman of the house subcommittee on International Trade.</p><p>Seeing this, Koh worked ahead of time to address Wrigley's concerns and prevent any roadblocks in the talks. They reached a compromise to sell certain gums in pharmacies.

The Sahara, with its sublime vastness, intricate fractal patterns etched into the dunes, and a celestial theater unfolding across the night sky, had an alien allure.

It's a world of stark simplicity, yet a closer look reveals an intricate network of survival and resilience. The dunes are endless, all paths are erased by wind and there is no obvious way out.</p><p>Negotiation shares the same paradox. You might see it as a straightforward transaction, a <em>give</em> and <em>take</em> if you will - but beneath the surface, it's a delicate dance of shifting perspectives and evolving interests. Similar to the Saharan landscape, negotiations are dynamic, alive and usually have no obvious way out. What you think you might want out of a negotiation today, might change tomorrow if you see what the counter-party is offering and vice-versa. </p><p>Embracing this complexity gets you into a robust mindset that allows for a dynamic exchange and creation of value. In any negotiation, complexity can be your ally or your enemy. Embrace it and you will have a better chance to get to a desirable outcome.</p><p>In the following paragraphs, I want to take the example of the Iran nuclear negotiations (Outcome: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Comprehensive_Plan_of_Action">JCPOA</a> - Joint Comprehensive Plan Of Action) and dive deep into it. In the next months, I will be publishing more articles about the JCPOA negotiations as I really think that this is one of those rare golden nuggets that we can learn from as negotiators.</p><h2>The Iran nuclear negotiations</h2><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa968d06f-8273-44f4-870a-bfdf2b2736f1_1948x1826.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa968d06f-8273-44f4-870a-bfdf2b2736f1_1948x1826.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa968d06f-8273-44f4-870a-bfdf2b2736f1_1948x1826.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa968d06f-8273-44f4-870a-bfdf2b2736f1_1948x1826.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa968d06f-8273-44f4-870a-bfdf2b2736f1_1948x1826.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa968d06f-8273-44f4-870a-bfdf2b2736f1_1948x1826.jpeg" width="1456" height="1365" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a968d06f-8273-44f4-870a-bfdf2b2736f1_1948x1826.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1365,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2174928,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa968d06f-8273-44f4-870a-bfdf2b2736f1_1948x1826.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa968d06f-8273-44f4-870a-bfdf2b2736f1_1948x1826.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa968d06f-8273-44f4-870a-bfdf2b2736f1_1948x1826.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa968d06f-8273-44f4-870a-bfdf2b2736f1_1948x1826.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">John Kerry (Lead US negotiator) and Javad Zarif (Lead Iranian negotiator)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Consider the long and intricate negotiations that led to the JCPOA, or the Iran nuclear deal, as a clear example of the complexity inherent in negotiations. This negotiation is probably the best example in the 21st century of how negotiations can solve tough global problems. This negotiation was not a simple transaction, but a multilateral negotiation involving Iran, the United States, and the P5+1 group, which includes Russia, China, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany, plus the European Union.</p><p>In these negotiations, each party had its own strategic interests. For instance, Iran desired the <strong>lifting of sanctions to improve its economic situation</strong>, while preserving as much of its nuclear program as possible for reasons of national pride and deterrence. The Western countries, led by the United States, sought to <strong>prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons</strong>, <strong>ensuring regional stability</strong> and global non-proliferation. On the other hand, Russia and China, though sharing the non-proliferation goal, had other geopolitical considerations, such as their <strong>respective relationships with the United States</strong>.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffacb7276-8e9d-4bec-af25-415a656f4467_1050x600.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffacb7276-8e9d-4bec-af25-415a656f4467_1050x600.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffacb7276-8e9d-4bec-af25-415a656f4467_1050x600.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffacb7276-8e9d-4bec-af25-415a656f4467_1050x600.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffacb7276-8e9d-4bec-af25-415a656f4467_1050x600.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffacb7276-8e9d-4bec-af25-415a656f4467_1050x600.png" width="1050" height="600" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/facb7276-8e9d-4bec-af25-415a656f4467_1050x600.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:600,&quot;width&quot;:1050,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:77760,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffacb7276-8e9d-4bec-af25-415a656f4467_1050x600.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffacb7276-8e9d-4bec-af25-415a656f4467_1050x600.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffacb7276-8e9d-4bec-af25-415a656f4467_1050x600.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffacb7276-8e9d-4bec-af25-415a656f4467_1050x600.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>The JCPOA negotiation was complex not only because of the numerous parties involved, but also because the interests of each party were shifting over time. For instance, the US stance towards the agreement changed significantly with different presidential administrations. During President Obama's tenure, the US was inclined towards the agreement, considering it a significant step towards preventing Iran's nuclear weapon development. However, under President Trump, the US withdrew from the agreement, citing concerns that it was not comprehensive enough and that it failed to address Iran's missile program and regional influence. With President Biden, the US indicated a desire to return to the agreement, albeit with potential revisions.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe2d320d4-3432-4b57-927c-c509d0aba8b5_3333x3333.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe2d320d4-3432-4b57-927c-c509d0aba8b5_3333x3333.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe2d320d4-3432-4b57-927c-c509d0aba8b5_3333x3333.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe2d320d4-3432-4b57-927c-c509d0aba8b5_3333x3333.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe2d320d4-3432-4b57-927c-c509d0aba8b5_3333x3333.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe2d320d4-3432-4b57-927c-c509d0aba8b5_3333x3333.jpeg" width="1456" height="1456" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e2d320d4-3432-4b57-927c-c509d0aba8b5_3333x3333.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1456,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2654375,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe2d320d4-3432-4b57-927c-c509d0aba8b5_3333x3333.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe2d320d4-3432-4b57-927c-c509d0aba8b5_3333x3333.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe2d320d4-3432-4b57-927c-c509d0aba8b5_3333x3333.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe2d320d4-3432-4b57-927c-c509d0aba8b5_3333x3333.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">General Facts on the JCPOA.

When it comes to the intricate issue of climate change, game theory can teach us a thing or two about getting countries to <strong>work together in harmony</strong>. </p><p>From commitment devices to repeated interactions, game theory has some groovy moves up its sleeve to help nations boogie down the path of cooperation.</p><h2><strong>Commitment Devices: The Diplomatic Handshake</strong></h2><p>If you've ever pinky-sworn with a friend to keep a secret, you know the power of a commitment device. In the world of climate diplomacy, commitment devices are like a firm handshake that helps countries show each other they mean business. </p><p>By pledging to specific emission reduction targets or policies, nations can demonstrate their dedication to combating climate change and increase trust among their peers.</p><p>Here are some examples of commitment devices that countries can use to prove they're serious about cutting a rug on the dance floor of climate action:</p><p> A) <strong>Legally binding agreements</strong>: Think of these as the "wedding vows" of climate commitment. Once a country ratifies a legally binding agreement, it's pledged to uphold its promises on both national and international stages.</p><p>B) <strong>Financial incentives for clean technology adoption</strong>: Countries can put their money where their mouths are by offering tax incentives and other financial perks for businesses and individuals who adopt eco-friendly technologies. It's like offering free dance lessons to anyone willing to try out a new move.</p><p><strong>C) Carbon pricing mechanisms</strong>: Last but not least, carbon pricing mechanisms (like the <a href="https://negotiations.substack.com/p/the-climate-series-are-carbon-markets">carbon markets</a> in the EU and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/16/business/energy-environment/china-carbon-market.html">China</a>) serve as the "cover charge" for polluting the atmosphere. By putting a price on carbon emissions, countries signal their commitment to reducing their carbon footprint and encourage others to do the same.</p><h2>Repeated Interactions: Building Trust and Encouraging Reciprocity</h2><p>Now let's take a closer look at the power of networks in promoting cooperation. Imagine a group of friends who grew up together, went to school together, and now find themselves working in different fields. They might not agree on everything, but their shared history and mutual understanding make it more likely that they'll work together to solve problems.</p><p>In the same way, countries that share alliances, trade partnerships, or other international connections can influence each other's behaviour through peer pressure and reciprocity. For example, consider the United States and China, two of the world's largest economies. As trade partners, they have a vested interest in each other's success, making them more likely to collaborate on initiatives like climate change.</p><p>By leveraging shared interests in areas such as trade or security, countries can nudge each other towards collaboration on climate change initiatives. It's like a group project where everyone's got a stake in the outcome, and working together just makes sense.</p><p>In the end, the world of international climate change cooperation is much like a complex social network, where <strong>trust</strong>, <strong>relationships</strong>, and <strong>shared interests</strong> intertwine to create a tapestry of collaboration. With game theory as our guide, we can navigate this intricate web and work towards a more sustainable, cooperative future for all.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://negotiations.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading Games &amp; Negotiations!

by van Eyck serves as a metaphor for the delicate balance between the conflicts of self-interest and cooperation in a negotiation.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Picture this: you are at the national gallery in London standing in front of one of the most famous paintings of all time: <a href="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/jan-van-eyck-the-arnolfini-portrait">The Arnolfini Portrait</a> by the brilliant Jan van Eyck. You look at the two figures in the painting, a wealthy merchant and his wife, and you can't help but feel a sense of mystery and intrigue. They're having a quiet conversation, with the merchant's hand resting on his wife's rounded belly, symbolizing the potential for new life and new beginnings. And just like that, it hits you - this painting is the perfect metaphor for the delicate balance that must be struck between self-interest and cooperation in any negotiation. The two figures in the painting negotiate the terms of their relationship, just like the parties in a negotiation are figuring out how to balance their self-interest with the need for cooperation. The painting serves as a reminder that negotiations can be subtle, complex, and full of hidden meaning, much like the enigmatic essence of The Arnolfini Portrait.</p><p>During the past decade or so, I have witnessed the persistent challenges that negotiators face in trying to achieve a balance between advancing their interests and fostering cooperation with their counterparts in order to arrive at a mutually beneficial agreement. This gets even more complicated when the negotiator is also driving an internal negotiation within their organization.</p><h2>What is the Negotiator's Dilemma?</h2><p>The <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0022103172900236">Negotiator's Dilemma</a> pertains to situations where each party involved in a negotiation has a strong incentive to act in their self-interest, even if such behaviour results in a sub-optimal outcome for all parties. This arises from the trade-off between individual gain and collective gain that is often inherent in negotiations. </p><p>The dilemma of whether or not to divulge intimate details about one's interests and priorities is the epitome of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch-22_(logic)">Catch-22</a>: On one hand, sharing such information could potentially yield great value, but on the other hand, it opens the door for the counter-party to take advantage. Conversely, if one opts to withhold such details, they run the risk of leaving opportunities on the table or reaching an impasse.</p><p>This interplay between conflicting incentives is what constitutes the Negotiator's Dilemma.</p><p>In game theory, the Negotiator's Dilemma can be modelled as a prisoner's dilemma game, where each party is presented with two possible actions: <strong>cooperate</strong> or <strong>compete</strong>. If both parties cooperate, they both get a positive outcome. However, if one party competes while the other cooperates, the competitor gets a better outcome and the cooperator has a poorer outcome. If both parties compete, both parties receive a negative outcome.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F916cde5b-f79a-499c-b873-e90246af0988_1050x600.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F916cde5b-f79a-499c-b873-e90246af0988_1050x600.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F916cde5b-f79a-499c-b873-e90246af0988_1050x600.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F916cde5b-f79a-499c-b873-e90246af0988_1050x600.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F916cde5b-f79a-499c-b873-e90246af0988_1050x600.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F916cde5b-f79a-499c-b873-e90246af0988_1050x600.png" width="1050" height="600" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/916cde5b-f79a-499c-b873-e90246af0988_1050x600.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:600,&quot;width&quot;:1050,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:60466,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F916cde5b-f79a-499c-b873-e90246af0988_1050x600.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F916cde5b-f79a-499c-b873-e90246af0988_1050x600.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F916cde5b-f79a-499c-b873-e90246af0988_1050x600.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F916cde5b-f79a-499c-b873-e90246af0988_1050x600.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Typical Prisoner&#8217;s Dilemma: The game makes &#8216;competing&#8217; the only natural and rational choice for individuals. Regardless of what the other players do - competition is the only way to go. Compete/Compete is the eventual outcome. </figcaption></figure></div><p>The dynamics in this game highlight why the Negotiator's Dilemma can be so difficult to overcome. Even though cooperation may result in a better outcome for both parties, the temptation to compete and prioritize one's interests is overwhelming. In a way, the prisoner&#8217;s dilemma is like a law of nature - it is almost impossible to overcome.</p><h2>So how do we overcome this natural law?</h2><p>Generally, there are a few ways to overcome the fate of a prisoner&#8217;s dilemma - here I am going to mention two: 1) <strong>Out-Of-Game Penalties</strong> and 2) <strong>Repeated Games</strong>.</p><h2>Out-Of-Game Penalties</h2><p>Suppose, for a moment, that in the prisoner's dilemma, the two parties involved are related - say, two siblings, or a father and son. In such a scenario, the strategy of both parties competing would likely not be effective, as the level of trust between them would far outweigh any potential gain from competing. Additionally, there may be societal pressures at play that would render competing a nonviable option, as one could quickly become an outcast within their community. Similar dynamics exist in the world of business as well, such as between an employee and their manager, or in long-term strategic partnerships between companies (Think Apple and TSMC for example).</p><h2>Repeated Games</h2><p>When negotiating with the same counter-party repeatedly, the traditional dynamics of the prisoner's dilemma can become somewhat muddled. Over time, the parties involved will begin to develop a degree of trust, resulting in what is known as the "Tit-For-Tat" strategy becoming the equilibrium. Under this approach, both parties strive to cooperate as much as possible during negotiations. If one party tries to aggressively gain an unfair advantage, it will be swiftly penalized in future negotiations. </p><p>The famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_truce">Christmas Truce of 1914</a> on the western front of WWI is essentially a result of the same effect.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F998e6d08-5978-4dea-904a-360bdc7d0fa4_2560x1536.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F998e6d08-5978-4dea-904a-360bdc7d0fa4_2560x1536.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F998e6d08-5978-4dea-904a-360bdc7d0fa4_2560x1536.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F998e6d08-5978-4dea-904a-360bdc7d0fa4_2560x1536.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F998e6d08-5978-4dea-904a-360bdc7d0fa4_2560x1536.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F998e6d08-5978-4dea-904a-360bdc7d0fa4_2560x1536.jpeg" width="1456" height="874" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/998e6d08-5978-4dea-904a-360bdc7d0fa4_2560x1536.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:874,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:565807,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F998e6d08-5978-4dea-904a-360bdc7d0fa4_2560x1536.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F998e6d08-5978-4dea-904a-360bdc7d0fa4_2560x1536.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F998e6d08-5978-4dea-904a-360bdc7d0fa4_2560x1536.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F998e6d08-5978-4dea-904a-360bdc7d0fa4_2560x1536.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">The Christmas truce of 1914 was a spontaneous ceasefire during World War I.

For example, a seller &#8216;Julie&#8217; could present a buyer &#8216;John&#8217; with a <em>Quotation Menu</em> of 3 options instead of just one Quotation. Suppose the 3 options are like this:</p><p>OPTION A: $ 200,000 | Payment Terms: 30 days | Delivery: At Factory</p><p>OPTION B: $ 220,000 | Payment Terms: 45 days | Delivery: At Factory</p><p>OPTION C: $ 240,000 | Payment Terms: 30 days | Full Delivery</p><p>Keep in mind that all 3 options are equivalent for Julie. If John selects any of the options, Julie would have been happy to close the deal. Note that all packages are fairly aggressive regarding the delivery as Julie does not wish to do delivery as it involves high cost and energy for her. She also prefers short payment terms as she runs a small family-owned company.</p><p>Suppose now, that John wants to have 45 days of payment terms and also wants the goods delivered, the options B and C signal to John that potentially Julie might strike a deal for a slightly higher price (Delivery is valued at $40,000 and 15-day payment term at $20,000, so maybe John counters with $250,000).</p><p>As we come to the end of our March 2023 edition of Games and Negotiations, I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to all of my readers.

To a seasoned negotiator, it is all that and more!</p><p>As a dear reader of my blog, you probably know all this already - after all this is Games &amp; Negotiations! I have been writing during the past year about real-life events where I see game theory and negotiations intersect, today I want to write about something a bit more abstract; the basics if you like.</p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://negotiations.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading Games &amp; Negotiations!

In this article and generally in this blog, I am focusing less on the artistic, and more on the essence of the negotiation game. In the following, I try to summarize this in three key aspects.</p><h2>The first commandment: (Real) Commitment</h2><p>If you want to take away one thing from this article, let it be this: commitment is your secret weapon in negotiations. Game Theory tells us that by making a true commitment, you can completely change the game in your favor. And what makes a commitment truly powerful? It needs to be linked to real incentives and consequences. Simply saying you'll do something doesn't cut it. In Game Theory speak, we call that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheap_talk">cheap talk</a>. You need to show the other party that there's skin in the game.</p><p>For example, let's say you're negotiating with a vendor for better prices. You could simply ask for a discount, but that might not be enough. Instead, you could commit to placing a larger order if the vendor agrees to lower prices. By doing this, you're showing the vendor that you're serious about the negotiation and that there are real benefits for them if they agree to your terms.</p><p>Another example could be in a job negotiation. If you're asking for a raise, you could simply state your case and hope for the best. But if you want to seal the deal, you could show your commitment by offering to take on additional responsibilities or work longer hours. This demonstrates to your employer that you're not just asking for more money, but that you're also willing to put in the effort to earn it.</p><p>As Nassim Taleb puts it in his famous Incerto Series: </p><div class="pullquote"><p>&#8220;Never trust someone who doesn't have skin in the game&#8221;</p></div><h2>The second commandment: Incentive Design</h2><p>Incentives can make or break a negotiation. By sweetening the deal, you show the other party that you're willing to go the extra mile to make the agreement work. And that's what it's all about, right? Finding common ground and making a deal that works for everyone.</p><p>Take a sales negotiation, for example. If the buyer is hesitant, you could offer a discount or a longer warranty to close the deal. But why stop there? You could also offer free shipping, a bonus item, or even a trial period. The key is to find what motivates the other side and use that to your advantage.</p><p>It's not just about discounts and bonuses, though. You can also get creative with the terms of the agreement. For example, if you're negotiating with a vendor for better prices, you could agree to pay upfront in exchange for a lower price. This shows the vendor that you're committed to the deal and that you're willing to make an investment to make it work.</p><p>In a job negotiation, you could offer to take on additional responsibilities or work longer hours in exchange for a raise. This demonstrates to your employer that you're not just asking for more money, but that you're also willing to put in the effort to earn it.</p><p>When both parties feel like they're getting a good deal, the negotiation becomes much smoother and more productive. Don't be afraid to get creative with incentives. A little extra effort can go a long way in sealing the deal. So, next time you find yourself in a negotiation, don't be afraid to think outside the box and come up with some creative incentives to sweeten the deal.</p><h2>The third commandment: Strategic Thinking</h2><p>Strategic thinking is a must-have skill for any high-impact negotiation. It requires a deep understanding of the other party's objectives, motivations, and constraints. This allows you to craft a negotiation strategy that meets both your needs and theirs.</p><p>One example of this is the use of the "BATNA" (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement) concept, which helps you understand the lowest acceptable outcome for you and the other party. Having a solid BATNA gives you more bargaining power, as it sets a clear limit to the negotiation.</p><p>Another important concept from strategic thinking is the idea of risk and reward. In any negotiation, it's crucial to weigh the potential risks and rewards of each decision you make. This means considering both short-term and long-term consequences, and being aware of what you're willing to compromise on. For example, in a salary negotiation, you may need to consider the immediate financial benefit versus the long-term job satisfaction and growth opportunities. By being mindful of the risk and reward balance, you can make more calculated and strategic decisions in your negotiations. In a negotiation with suppliers, you should consider potential non-commercial risks and rewards the various suppliers present to you as part of their offering and business case. Most of the time - your options are not between buying and not-buying, but rather buying from supplier A or from supplier B.</p><p>So, when it comes down to it, strategic thinking is an important tool in your negotiation toolkit. Understanding your opponent's needs and motivations, having a clear strategy in mind, and being open to creative solutions are all key components of a winning negotiation. And remember, negotiations aren't just about getting what you want, they're <strong>about finding a solution that works for everyone</strong>. </p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://negotiations.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading Games &amp; Negotiations!

pressing issues of our time. Carbon markets have been proposed as one solution to help reduce climate change. Carbon markets would create incentives to reduce our reliance on carbon, incentivize companies to invest in green technology and allow for an energy transition to happen smoothly. Theoretically, this sounds amazing. However, carbon markets are far from being the solution to climate change.</p><h2>What are Carbon Markets anyway?</h2><p>Before we get into the details of carbon markets, we have to come to terms with one major point: carbon emissions are a <strong>finite resource</strong>. We can't keep pumping large amounts of carbon into the atmosphere without further damaging the climate. Some sectors can reduce their emissions relatively cheaply and without much effort: for example, the tech industry. Companies like Google and Facebook can simply use 100% renewable electricity for their data centres. Other sectors, however, such as the shipping or airline industry, can't reduce emissions as much since electric planes or electric ship engines don't exist yet.</p><p>Therefore, a carbon market is a mechanism that allows for the trading of carbon emissions. This mechanism creates a price for carbon, which in turn incentivizes companies to reduce their emissions. For example, a company that cannot reduce its emissions can purchase carbon credits from a company that has been able to reduce its emissions. In this way, the carbon market encourages companies to reduce their emissions as much as possible.</p><p>There are currently carbon markets in place in various countries around the world, including the European Union, China, and Australia.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1501523460185-2aa5d2a0f981?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwzMDAzMzh8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw0fHxjYXJib24lMjBtYXJrZXR8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjY3MDE2NjY0&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=1080" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1501523460185-2aa5d2a0f981?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwzMDAzMzh8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw0fHxjYXJib24lMjBtYXJrZXR8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjY3MDE2NjY0&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=1080 424w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1501523460185-2aa5d2a0f981?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwzMDAzMzh8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw0fHxjYXJib24lMjBtYXJrZXR8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjY3MDE2NjY0&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=1080 848w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1501523460185-2aa5d2a0f981?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwzMDAzMzh8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw0fHxjYXJib24lMjBtYXJrZXR8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjY3MDE2NjY0&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=1080 1272w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1501523460185-2aa5d2a0f981?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwzMDAzMzh8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw0fHxjYXJib24lMjBtYXJrZXR8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjY3MDE2NjY0&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=1080 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1501523460185-2aa5d2a0f981?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwzMDAzMzh8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw0fHxjYXJib24lMjBtYXJrZXR8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjY3MDE2NjY0&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=1080" width="1080" height="673" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1501523460185-2aa5d2a0f981?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwzMDAzMzh8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw0fHxjYXJib24lMjBtYXJrZXR8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjY3MDE2NjY0&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=1080&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:673,&quot;width&quot;:1080,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;person in white top&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="person in white top" title="person in white top" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1501523460185-2aa5d2a0f981?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwzMDAzMzh8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw0fHxjYXJib24lMjBtYXJrZXR8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjY3MDE2NjY0&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=1080 424w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1501523460185-2aa5d2a0f981?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwzMDAzMzh8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw0fHxjYXJib24lMjBtYXJrZXR8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjY3MDE2NjY0&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=1080 848w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1501523460185-2aa5d2a0f981?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwzMDAzMzh8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw0fHxjYXJib24lMjBtYXJrZXR8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjY3MDE2NjY0&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=1080 1272w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1501523460185-2aa5d2a0f981?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MnwzMDAzMzh8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw0fHxjYXJib24lMjBtYXJrZXR8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjY3MDE2NjY0&amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;q=80&amp;w=1080 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Carbon Markets have the same mechanism as any other market. The only goods being traded here are the &#8216;rights to pollute&#8217; i.e. &#8216;carbon emissions&#8217;.</figcaption></figure></div><p>The most well-known carbon market is the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), which was introduced in 2005. The EU ETS covers around 11,000 power plants and manufacturing facilities in 30 countries. These facilities are required to purchase allowances for every ton of carbon dioxide they emit. The number of allowances available each year is reduced over time, so businesses have an incentive to reduce their emissions to avoid having to purchase more allowances.</p><p>The EU ETS is a cap-and-trade system, which means that there is a limit (or cap) on the total amount of emissions that can be emitted by businesses covered by the system. Businesses that emit less than their allotted emissions allowances can sell their allowances to businesses that emit more than their allotment. The price of allowances is set by the market, and businesses must purchase allowances to emit carbon dioxide. The EU ETS has been in operation since 2005, and it is the largest carbon market in the world. </p><p>Another example of a carbon market is the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), which is a cap-and-trade system that covers nine states in the northeastern United States. The RGGI was created in 2009, and it is the first carbon market in the United States. The RGGI works similarly to the EU ETS, with businesses purchasing allowances to emit carbon dioxide. The RGGI has been successful in reducing emissions, and it has also generated revenue for participating states.</p><h2>Why do carbon markets work?</h2><p>Game Theory teaches us that incentives are powerful motivators. On average rational actors would follow their best interest. In the case of carbon markets, businesses are financially incentivized to reduce their emissions. This is because polluting the atmosphere now has financial consequences which impact the bottom line of companies. In other words, companies are losing money by emitting carbon into the atmosphere. As a result, businesses have a strong incentive to reduce their emissions. </p><p>Carbon markets also create a market for emission reductions. This means businesses can buy and sell emissions reductions. This provides a financial incentive for businesses to invest in emissions-reducing technologies and practices. By investing in these technologies and practices, businesses can reduce their emissions and sell their emissions reductions. This is a win-win situation for businesses and the environment.</p><p>This sounds great &#8230; so why aren&#8217;t carbon markets the main tool to fight climate change?</p><h2>Issues and limitations of carbon markets</h2><p>Carbon markets are a potentially useful tool for managing emissions, but there are a number of issues and shortcomings that need to be considered. </p><p>One issue is that these markets can be easily manipulated by businesses and individuals. This can lead to a situation where the market price of carbon does not reflect the true cost of emissions. This can make it difficult to use carbon markets to drive down emissions in a meaningful way. For example, companies would release a lot of emissions when prices are low (i.e. due to geopolitics such as the war in Ukraine). The price of carbon as any other commodity might not correlate with the true cost in any meaningful way.</p><p>Another issue with carbon markets is that they can create perverse incentives. A famous example is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perverse_incentive">cobra effect</a>. During the British rule of India, the British government in Delhi was nervous about the number of cobras in the city. As a way to reduce the number of cobras around Delhi, they have started a programme in which they give money to anyone that catches a cobra. At the start, this worked great. However enterprising individuals noticed they don&#8217;t need to catch cobras to make money, they can just breed them! This made the cobra numbers rise exponentially and forced the British government to shut down the programme. The bred cobras were released as now there is no market for them - making the issue even worse than before.</p><p>Building on that story, If a business is able to reduce its emissions by shutting down a factory, it will receive a financial reward. This could create an incentive for businesses to outsource their emissions-intensive activities to developing countries where environmental regulations are weaker and carbon markets do not exist yet. </p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Overall, carbon markets are a potentially useful tool for managing emissions. However, they need to be designed carefully to avoid any negative consequences.</p><p></p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://negotiations.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Thanks for reading Games &amp; Negotiations!

The country has been suffering from severe power cuts, fuel &amp; gas shortages as well as fertilizer shortages due to the war on Ukraine, a high debt to GDP ratio and rising global inflation. After the pandemic, tourism - an extremely important industry in the country - totally collapsed.</p><p>In June 2022, Sri Lanka started discussions with the IMF to solve its sovereign debt crisis. As of July 2022, the situation in the country has escalated dramatically given that fuel and other necessities became virtually not available. This led to wide protests; Eventually, president Rajapaksa left the country.</p><h2>Understanding the Sovereign Debt Crisis: Who holds Sri Lanka&#8217;s Sovereign Debt?</h2><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a61c2fd-8377-4db8-857e-59295ca20527_1050x600.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a61c2fd-8377-4db8-857e-59295ca20527_1050x600.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a61c2fd-8377-4db8-857e-59295ca20527_1050x600.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a61c2fd-8377-4db8-857e-59295ca20527_1050x600.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a61c2fd-8377-4db8-857e-59295ca20527_1050x600.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a61c2fd-8377-4db8-857e-59295ca20527_1050x600.png" width="1050" height="600" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2a61c2fd-8377-4db8-857e-59295ca20527_1050x600.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:600,&quot;width&quot;:1050,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:63817,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a61c2fd-8377-4db8-857e-59295ca20527_1050x600.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a61c2fd-8377-4db8-857e-59295ca20527_1050x600.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a61c2fd-8377-4db8-857e-59295ca20527_1050x600.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2a61c2fd-8377-4db8-857e-59295ca20527_1050x600.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Sri Lanka Foreign Debtor Distribution (Data <a href="http://www.erd.gov.lk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=102&amp;Itemid=308&amp;lang=en">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Most debt (47%) is held by commercial institutions that own Sri Lankan Sovereign Government Bonds. Bonds are debt instruments that are sold through global capital markets. Muti-lateral institutions (the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank) hold about 20% of the debt and a further 20% is bilateral debt held by China and Japan respectively. </p><p>From a debtor perspective, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/complex-web-creditors-politics-threatens-sri-lanka-restructuring-2022-04-28/">Sri Lankan debt</a> can be split into 4 broad groups:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Multi-lateral institution debt</strong> (ADB, World Bank): ~22% of total debt, this debt generally cannot be restructured as this type of debt is last resort debt per se. It is refinanced with a newer package from the multilateral institutions. For this reason, I won&#8217;t consider this group of debtors in this article.</p></li><li><p><strong><a href="https://clubdeparis.org/en/communications/page/permanent-members">Paris Club </a>debt</strong> ~ 10% of total debt: Mainly Japan. Paris club is an alliance of 22 countries that negotiate as a block with the indebted country. An important consideration is that Paris club treatments usually contain conditional clauses that force the debtor country to seek the same treatment from other debt holders.</p></li><li><p><strong>Non-Paris Club debt</strong> ~ 10%: Mainly China. Bilateral agreements with China are generally granted through its export bank (China Exim Bank) or other Chinese institutions. Generally, such debt includes clauses that explicitly remove any treatment through the Paris Club.</p></li><li><p><strong>Commercial debt</strong> ~ 47%: Private bondholders. For simplification purposes, this analysis will also ignore this group of debtors.</p></li></ul><h2>Debtors, The Paris Club &amp; The prisoner&#8217;s dilemma</h2><p>As a debt holder, a party is incentivized to get into an alliance with other debt holders to remove any non-equal treatment (issue of <a href="https://www.files.ethz.ch/isn/187274/pb_no53.pdf">inter-creditor equity</a>), increase the negotiating position vs the indebted country and reduce the cost of negotiations. This has led to the creation of the <strong>Paris club</strong> where 22 countries negotiate as one entity according to certain standards and rules. In recent decades, however, and with the rise of the Chinese economy, it is clear that China wants to negotiate its debt separately from the Paris club or other alliances. From a game theory perspective, this could be leveraged for the benefit of the indebted country as it effectively creates competition between Paris Club and Non-Paris Club entities. This creates a certain <strong>prisoner&#8217;s dilemma </strong>situation for all debt holders as they would wish to get better terms offered vs the other debt holders. </p><h2>How a game-theoretic process would look like?</h2><p>This process assumes the indebted country already knows its negotiation targets (i.e. how much net present value of the debt must be removed) and has already agreed with the IMF on the economic &amp; fiscal policies required to get the country back to a sustainable balance sheet.</p><h2>Solving For Level 2: Commitment &amp; Communication</h2><p>This is arguably the most important part of this process. Before an indebted country starts with any restructuring discussions, it should commit (preferably through a law, a national assembly or a wide range of talks with all relevant level 2 constituencies) that sovereign debt restructuring can only be executed through this process. This commitment must be communicated clearly to all debt holders. A commitment on this scale is beneficial to debt holders as well as the indebted country. The debt holders will have the certainty that no side deals are done with other debt holders and that creditors are treated through the same process. It also effectively removes the payout of holdout creditors as holdout creditors will not receive any compensation outside the process. As for the indebted country, this will drastically reduce negotiation costs as it streamlines all discussions in one process.</p><h2>The Negotiation Process</h2><p>I would propose a 2-phase process to maximally utilize competition between Non-Paris Club and Paris Club debt holders. A (or more) representative(s) from Non-Paris Club and a representative from the Paris club are invited for negotiations.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b1ab446-5e34-4c25-9dfe-35bff7e6bd9c_1050x600.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b1ab446-5e34-4c25-9dfe-35bff7e6bd9c_1050x600.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b1ab446-5e34-4c25-9dfe-35bff7e6bd9c_1050x600.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b1ab446-5e34-4c25-9dfe-35bff7e6bd9c_1050x600.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b1ab446-5e34-4c25-9dfe-35bff7e6bd9c_1050x600.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b1ab446-5e34-4c25-9dfe-35bff7e6bd9c_1050x600.png" width="1050" height="600" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5b1ab446-5e34-4c25-9dfe-35bff7e6bd9c_1050x600.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:600,&quot;width&quot;:1050,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:133167,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b1ab446-5e34-4c25-9dfe-35bff7e6bd9c_1050x600.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b1ab446-5e34-4c25-9dfe-35bff7e6bd9c_1050x600.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b1ab446-5e34-4c25-9dfe-35bff7e6bd9c_1050x600.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b1ab446-5e34-4c25-9dfe-35bff7e6bd9c_1050x600.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><h3>Phase 1</h3><p>The goal behind this phase is to incentivize the countries to provide a competitive proposal on what they would accept as a debt relief solution. Countries could also propose general diplomatic asks such as free-trade agreements, prioritization of certain commodities,&#8230;</p><p>After submission, the proposals are evaluated and probability discounted. A single Deal Present Value (DPV) summarizes this evaluation. The outcome of phase 1 is a ranked list of proposals from the invited parties.</p><h3>Phase 2</h3><p>This phase starts with approaching the highest-ranked party with a DPV-based deal. The party could either accept this deal, in which case the deal is closed immediately. This party receives per design the highest outcome (i.e. no other party is offered the same or a better deal). The offered party could also reject the deal, in which case the next ranked party is offered the same deal.</p><p>In case of total rejection, a new round is started with a higher DPV. The negotiations are continued until all outstanding debt has been restructured.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Today, debt relief negotiations are extremely costly from a process perspective, due to a <a href="https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/News/Seminars/2018/091318SovDebt-conference/chapter-8-the-debt-restructuring-process.ashx">myriad of reasons</a>. Game Theory &amp; Mechanism Design could provide an excellent path to optimize outcomes for the involved parties.

It was a different world back then.</figcaption></figure></div><h3>You wake up in Novo-Ogaryovo</h3><p>Your army chief is reluctant to tell you about the real situation on the ground north of Kyiv and west of Kharkiv. Your team is a sugar-coating, group-think ridden bunch of <em>Papageis</em>. But never mind, You are Ex-KGB. You understand this. You understand global power dynamics. In fact, you have gathered unmatchable power in Russia in the last 30 years.</p><p>Today your Troops are advancing slowly &#8212; a bit slower than you would like. Ukraine is showing strong resistance, but your men are telling you everything is under control. They might lose some battles, but you will win the war. Your escalation orders are underway, you want to show the world how strong your army is. You demand respect, you want your enemies to fear you. At the end of the day, you command one of the most powerful armies in the world. In a traditional war, you are certain Ukraine&#8217;s cities will not hold long.</p><p>So far and for months now, your enemies are becoming stronger and more united. After the war started, even Germany is sending weapons to Ukraine. &#8220;Neutral&#8221; Switzerland is siding with Ukraine and Turkey is sending drones. The US, Europe and their allies mobilized a global world order of unmatchable scale. They sanctioned Russian companies, closed airspace, sanctioned Russian Billionaires and even banned Russia from the Swift Network. The global media machine is waging the strongest campaign in decades against Russia. Social media &#8212; A tool mastered by Russian operators is blowing up with global Ukrainian support. Is it Checkmate?</p><h2>Putin&#8217;s Interests</h2><p>Hopefully, you&#8217;re closer to the state of mind of Putin right now. I don&#8217;t know Putin&#8217;s real goals of this war, what he really wants to achieve. To some, he wants to control Ukraine &amp; transform it into a Pro-Russia buffer zone. Reduce NATO forces to before 1997 &#8212;  It may be. To others, it may also be that he is more and more cornered globally and he needs to secure his vision and his legacy. Achieving a multipolar world with politically close partners like China. There might be internal reasons as well. Putin controls the narrative in Russia and war can be a powerful catalyst to whatever plans Putin has for the Russian people.</p><h2>Putin&#8217;s Options</h2><p>I think all options are on the table for Putin. The man is isolated, threatened and facing the biggest coalition in modern history. Don&#8217;t be mistaken; Putin still has a lot of leverage:</p><ul><li><p>He might stop gas supplies to Europe</p></li><li><p>He might call for concrete military &amp; economic support from China &amp; other countries &#8212; Creating an official alliance with China </p></li><li><p>He could attack non-NATO neighbours outside Russia such as Moldova, Georgia and Finland</p></li><li><p>He might completely destroy Ukraine with chemical weapons, traditional weapons and create the biggest humanitarian catastrophe in Europe in the recent history</p></li><li><p>He could attack NATO members if <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/02/28/world-war-iii-already-there-00012340">a point of no return is reached</a>. This could even include Nuclear Weapons.</p></li></ul><p>To the Ukrainians negotiating today with the Russians, they must understand Putin&#8217;s real goals and his BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement) to reach a positive outcome. Back-channels and side-channels between the US and Russia must work very hard to find a start to the conversation. Putin&#8217;s BATNA is to keep increasing the pressure &#8212; for the Ukrainians, it&#8217;s to keep resisting &amp; to keep their allies engaged.</p><p>Sadly, in my opinion, I don&#8217;t see signs of an <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/sg/academic/subjects/politics-international-relations/international-relations-and-international-organisations/how-negotiations-end-negotiating-behavior-endgame?format=HB">endgame in these negotiations</a>. This conflict will continue until a fundamental change of the strategic equation happens. </p><p>Preventing war is much easier than stopping it. The world failed at the former, but it doesn&#8217;t afford to keep the latter.</p><p></p><p class="button-wrapper"

German Chancellor <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/olaf-scholz/t-57304267">Olaf Scholz</a> has been visiting Russia in a bid to de-escalate the current crisis in eastern Ukraine. Initial talks seem to be <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/opinion-putin-hosts-scholz-war-called-off-for-now/a-60805272">successful</a> in establishing the first steps of de-escalation after announcements from the Russians to pull some troops from the Ukrainian borders.</p><p>A few days later, the situation seems to have escalated to new highs as the &#8216;signalling&#8217; war reaches an almost maximum. Ukraine has communicated that ceasefire in the Donbas region has been broken several times, Russia committed that it will protect its &#8216;citizens&#8217; in East Ukraine against aggressions and most importantly Biden has said today that <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/2/18/biden-says-us-believes-putin-has-decided-to-invade-ukraine">Putin has decided to go to war </a>already.

This is where NATO actively sends troops to Ukraine to fight against Russian troops. Considering both powers have nuclear weapons, the consequences of such a conflict are simply impossible to imagine for any sane individual. </p><h3>Outcome B</h3><p>This is the outcome if Russia invades Ukraine and NATO does not fight back directly. This will lead to an all-out war in Ukraine, millions of refugees in Europe, a major destabilisation in the Black Sea and East Europe &amp; painful sanctions on Russia. This would include stopping Russian Gas and blocking Russian companies from the Swift system. This is a very painful outcome for Russia, Ukraine and NATO. Russia will not be able to achieve its goals by following this path, nor would any other party benefit from it.</p><p>Another path for Putin would be to not start a fight, but credibly threaten to start an invasion.</p><h3>Outcome C</h3><p>Similar to Outcome A &#8212; This is a catastrophic outcome for Russia and NATO. By attacking Russia, NATO will essentially start a 3rd world war. </p><h3>Outcome D: The Chicken Game</h3><p>In this scenario &#8212; Russia is not starting an invasion but is negotiating under the threat of an invasion. This creates a chicken game between Russia, the Ukraine &amp; NATO. This is the only outcome in my opinion where Russia might achieve its goals. </p><h3>So how can this situation be solved?</h3><p>A chicken game is solved through a visible &amp; credible commitment. The first party to make this <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/game-theory/">cortezean</a> commitment will have the upper hand in the negotiations. </p><p>Both parties have been signalling this commitment, however in my opinion these commitments are not credible enough. For instance, NATO has sent troops to Poland, sent weapons and signalled to stop Nord Stream 2. Harris has announced today in the MSC that the US will inflict painful economic sanctions on Russia in case of an invasion. On the other hand, Russia has put more than 130,000 troops on the ground ready to invade. </p><p>A credible commitment that NATO could immediately make is to issue a conditional membership to Ukraine. NATO should put Ukraine&#8217;s membership on the agenda. The moment Russia Invades Ukraine, NATO commits to pass the membership immediately. On the other hand, NATO should also commit to removing Ukraine&#8217;s membership from the Agenda, the moment Russia removes its troops from the border. Therefore Russia now has a dilemma, if they invade Ukraine, they are allowing NATO to interfere directly. If they don&#8217;t invade Ukraine and remove their troops, they can make a win. If this is packaged and framed correctly to the constituents, Putin will save face and might score a political win.</p><p>A credible commitment that Russia could make is to give an ultimatum to Ukraine: Give us a guarantee you will not join NATO and we will remove our troops from the Border. Don&#8217;t give us a guarantee and we will make sure Ukraine is not part of NATO by invading Ukraine.</p><p>What would happen in the next few days? Let&#8217;s hope the game is played by rational players. </p><p></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Squid Game]]></title><description><![CDATA[Squid game is a popular Korean series

The show has broken all streaming records - it is now the most-streamed series in the history of Netflix.</p><p>Squid Game is about 456 people competing for a big cash prize by playing Korean childhood games. After the first shock of the first game &#8216;Red light, green light&#8217;, the participants discover that they get 100 million KRW (about 100k USD) every time a player dies.</p><p>Squid game is therefore a classical zero-sum game, i.e. your loss is an immediate win for me and vice versa. The only way to increase the pie is to let others die as their death equals more money for the living. As the director Hwang Dong-hyuk puts it, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/squid-game-director-hwang-dong-hyuk-spc-hnk/index.html">this is a story about losers</a>.</p><blockquote><p>For Hwang, the show's narrative reflects the "competitive society" we live in today. "This is a story about losers," he said -- those who struggle through the challenges of everyday life and get left behind, while the "winners level up."</p></blockquote><h2>Game-Theoretic Analysis</h2><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb132e44-4e48-4362-9274-3201055012ca_1952x1098.webp" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb132e44-4e48-4362-9274-3201055012ca_1952x1098.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb132e44-4e48-4362-9274-3201055012ca_1952x1098.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb132e44-4e48-4362-9274-3201055012ca_1952x1098.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb132e44-4e48-4362-9274-3201055012ca_1952x1098.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb132e44-4e48-4362-9274-3201055012ca_1952x1098.webp" width="1456" height="819" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cb132e44-4e48-4362-9274-3201055012ca_1952x1098.webp&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:819,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:748962,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/webp&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb132e44-4e48-4362-9274-3201055012ca_1952x1098.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb132e44-4e48-4362-9274-3201055012ca_1952x1098.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb132e44-4e48-4362-9274-3201055012ca_1952x1098.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb132e44-4e48-4362-9274-3201055012ca_1952x1098.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Guards vs Players, @Netflix</figcaption></figure></div><p>Even though the game is fundamentally a zero-sum game, to win the whole game, you need to win 6 sequential games. Some games require cooperation &amp; forming alliances such as Tug-of-War, others require competition such as the final squid game. This creates a very interesting plot for the series as today&#8217;s friends are destined to become tomorrow&#8217;s enemies through the Game Design. Another interesting mechanism is how players can end the game any time - all they have to do is to organize a vote. If the majority decides to end the games, everybody can go back to their lives with no money. An important game-theoretic concept during the series is that game rules are law. When the organizers found a few guards colluding with a player, all involved have been killed and displayed to everybody else. </p><p>This is mechanism design doing what it&#8217;s supposed to do - by creating a rule set, making sure the rules are law, you are effectively creating a desired behavioural path for the players and the viewers. This desired behaviour of cooperation and competition implicitly lets the viewers connect and emphasize with the protagonists as they identify with them. </p><h2>Behavioural science &amp; Rationality</h2><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a3c42cb-368f-491d-8cc6-01aa2c4edcec_960x649.webp" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a3c42cb-368f-491d-8cc6-01aa2c4edcec_960x649.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a3c42cb-368f-491d-8cc6-01aa2c4edcec_960x649.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a3c42cb-368f-491d-8cc6-01aa2c4edcec_960x649.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a3c42cb-368f-491d-8cc6-01aa2c4edcec_960x649.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a3c42cb-368f-491d-8cc6-01aa2c4edcec_960x649.webp" width="960" height="649" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5a3c42cb-368f-491d-8cc6-01aa2c4edcec_960x649.webp&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:649,&quot;width&quot;:960,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:61464,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/webp&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a3c42cb-368f-491d-8cc6-01aa2c4edcec_960x649.webp 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a3c42cb-368f-491d-8cc6-01aa2c4edcec_960x649.webp 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a3c42cb-368f-491d-8cc6-01aa2c4edcec_960x649.webp 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a3c42cb-368f-491d-8cc6-01aa2c4edcec_960x649.webp 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class="image-caption">Green Light, Red Light @Netflix</figcaption></figure></div><p>Even though the players are allowed to stop the games, by voting to stop - They did so once at the start - however later on as the money increased, no votes have taken place. Rationally, death equals an infinite loss for the player, they continue to play. It&#8217;s clear that the players are not acting rationally and that there are strong behavioural biases in play on top of the mechanism design rules.</p><p>The money &#8220;Piggy Bank&#8221; is a transparent vault and has been prominently displayed on top of the players - they can see live when it is increasing and how big it is. I suspect this creates a feeling of ownership for the survivors (endowment effect). They will effectively fight any chance to remove the probability of going home with nothing. They also feel that their life is perhaps worthless outside of the game, so the game gives them a purpose and a meaning. Their weak BATNA has been over-signalled and amplified by the organizers as they have only selected people with large debts. The organizers have even publicly stated this to one player that wanted to quit.</p><p>While the game goes on, more players die or are killed - the money increases in size and the winners feel an even more amplified loss aversion as losing here not only means death but also that the other players will benefit from the player&#8217;s death.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>The creators of Squid Game combined excellent mechanism design techniques as well as nudges from behavioural science to create a series that went immediately viral and has broken all streaming records so far. </p><p>If you haven&#8217;t watched the series, I definitely recommend watching it!

take complete control of Kabul &amp; other big Afghan cities. All within a few hours - After 20 years of fighting, the Afghan Army simply ran out of steam and gave up. </p><p>So What happened?</p><p><strong>The power of Commitment &amp; Signalling</strong></p><p>Let&#8217;s get back to last year - While the world was battling the Corona Virus, negotiations have been ongoing between the US and the Taliban in Doha. As an outcome of the US <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/2/29/afghanistans-taliban-us-sign-agreement-aimed-at-ending-war">negotiations with the Taliban</a> (also known as the Doha Agreement), The US has committed to a full withdrawal of its troops by end of August 2021. The US commitment has been contingent on a set of conditions upon which the US would achieve its strategic goals and offer the Taliban a way forward to the governance of the country. The outcome of these negotiations has been widely communicated &amp; globally publicized.</p><p>Ever since the agreement Taliban has been testing the strength of the US commitment.  Violence in the country post-agreement actually went up and the attacks against the Afghan Army &amp; security forces have surged dramatically. With the date of the withdrawal coming closer, the Taliban have been slowly taking over small towns &amp; rural areas. In this environment, the US did signal that it is not changing its strategy and will be withdrawing its troops as scheduled. A few weeks after that, the Taliban has during a weekend essentially taken over the whole country.</p><p>The US commitment has been a strong signal to the Taliban that they can simply wait the US intervention out. This signal was also very strong to the Afghan Government that the game has changed. The US has decided to leave and an ultimatum has to be drawn in the sand.</p><p>By committing to a withdrawal date, the US started the clock for the demise of the Afghan government. The single biggest leverage the Taliban has had in the last 20 years has been time. </p><p>From a United States perspective, I believe the US did not have a choice, but to withdraw and manage the aftermath. Let&#8217;s analyze the different outcomes based on the decision tree below:</p><p></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F325f19fa-eae8-4f49-940e-e1ddaf7495ba_500x500.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F325f19fa-eae8-4f49-940e-e1ddaf7495ba_500x500.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F325f19fa-eae8-4f49-940e-e1ddaf7495ba_500x500.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F325f19fa-eae8-4f49-940e-e1ddaf7495ba_500x500.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F325f19fa-eae8-4f49-940e-e1ddaf7495ba_500x500.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F325f19fa-eae8-4f49-940e-e1ddaf7495ba_500x500.png" width="500" height="500" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/325f19fa-eae8-4f49-940e-e1ddaf7495ba_500x500.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:500,&quot;width&quot;:500,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:49565,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F325f19fa-eae8-4f49-940e-e1ddaf7495ba_500x500.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F325f19fa-eae8-4f49-940e-e1ddaf7495ba_500x500.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F325f19fa-eae8-4f49-940e-e1ddaf7495ba_500x500.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F325f19fa-eae8-4f49-940e-e1ddaf7495ba_500x500.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p><strong>Scenario 1: Fight, Fight</strong></p><p>This scenario has been playing out in the last 20 years where the US and the Taliban keep fighting in an endless loop. In this scenario, the US suffers huge financial and political losses as it is playing the infinite game with the Taliban. The Taliban gets its legitimacy from fighting the US and therefore they will incur a small cost, but the US will incur a huge loss (Outcome A).</p><p><strong>Scenario 2: Fight, Collaborate</strong></p><p>In this scenario, the US will keep fighting with a strong presence in Afghanistan while the Taliban will stop fighting and decide to collaborate with the US. Potentially this means that there is a new enemy in Afghanistan. In this scenario, the US will still incur big losses since its losses are related to the fact it is present in Afghanistan. The political losses are also huge as the US cannot justify to its constituents why it is still fighting in Afghanistan. On the other hand, Taliban losses are also big as its political capital is fully derived from fighting the US (Outcome B).</p><p><strong>Scenario 3: Collaborate, Fight</strong></p><p>In this scenario, the US withdraws, but the Taliban keeps its hostilities and potentially keep fighting the US. Basically, this is the scenario that would have happened if the US withdrew immediately after bombing the Taliban in 2001. </p><p>In this case, the US will suffer a smaller loss compared to scenarios 1 and 2, as its mission is quick but unfinished. Economically this might make sense, however politically it&#8217;s a dangerous strategy as this will signal to the world that the US did not eliminate the threat and is strategically changing its role post world war II. From a Taliban perspective, they will gain significant authority among their supporters since they will be able to sell this as a win against the US (Outcome C).</p><p><strong>Scenario 4: Collaborate, Collaborate</strong></p><p>In this scenario, the US and the Taliban will reach some kind of understanding. The US withdraws from Afghanistan, while the Taliban assures the US that it will keep the terrorists at bay. In this scenario, the outcome for the United States is much better than scenario 3 as it is has stopped the fighting. Politically, however, this option is extremely hard to navigate as the US needs to reshape the narrative regarding the Taliban, manage a very risky withdrawal that is largely based on trusting the Taliban and manage its domestic political scene as the divisiveness in the US reaches historic levels. From a Taliban perspective, I believe this will even strengthen their position as they are able to sell a winning story at home. They will also be able to position themselves as a legitimate authority in Afghan politics that did not only win against the US but got its backing too (Outcome D).</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>By looking at the decision tree, it&#8217;s obvious that the US has only one option: collaborate. I believe as long as the Taliban narrative as a protector and a political power in Afghanistan stands and takes shape, the Taliban will also most likely collaborate too. However, I believe this equilibrium is rather fragile. External players, other factions within the Taliban that are not happy with the status quo and other Afghan players can easily change the dynamics of this Game. Will this end the conflict in this country? let&#8217;s wait and see.</p><p></p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
